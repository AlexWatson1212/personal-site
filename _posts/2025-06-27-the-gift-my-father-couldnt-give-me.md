There’s something I’ve been reclaiming lately that I didn’t even know I was missing.

Space.

Not physical space, but the **right to exist fully**. To take up room. To hold ground. To speak calmly and confidently. To trust my anger without being consumed by it.  
And as I’ve stepped into that, I’ve realised:

> **This is a gift my father never gave me.  
Not because he didn’t want to — but because he didn’t really have it himself.**

---

He didn’t know how to model self-respect.  
He didn’t know how to hold space without controlling it.  
He didn’t know how to be present without shrinking or exploding.  
And so, I learned to stay small. To read the room. To flinch before speaking.  
To avoid taking up too much.

And now, every time I pause and let myself **fully arrive** —  
in a conversation, in a room, in a moment of confrontation —  
I feel that part of me say: *“Can I really stand here?”*

And the answer, now, is always:  
> *“Yeah. I fucking can.”*

---

I used to think that anger was dangerous.  
That presence was threatening.  
That claiming space meant stealing it from someone else.

But I see now — it’s just balance.  
**It’s just giving myself what no one else thought to offer.**  
Not to dominate. Not to prove.  
Just to stand. To breathe. To exist in full.

---

This is the masculinity I’m rebuilding —  
Not borrowed. Not reactive. Not hollowed out by ego.

Grounded. Respectful. Present. Unshaken.

And if I pass one thing to my son, let it be this:  
> That he doesn’t have to shrink to survive.  
> That his presence isn’t a threat.  
> That his anger isn’t the enemy.  
> That taking up space is his birthright — and no one can take that from him.

---

**This is the gift I was never given.  
So I’m giving it to myself.  
And one day, to him.**

Because the cycle ends here.
