Music hasn’t necessarily healed me.

But it’s **comforted me**,  
**Remembered me**,  
And helped me rediscover parts of my soul I didn’t know were still alive.

---

There’s something about music that lets me see into myself.  
Not just who I am now—but who I’ve been. Who I tried to be. Who I had to be to survive.

When I hear a song that resonated deeply with me at one point in life, it’s like looking into an old mirror.  
It shines a light on what I was feeling back then—even if I couldn’t name it at the time.

Sometimes I listen and think,  
> *“God, I must have been in so much pain to feel this so deeply.”*

And the music responds:  
**Yes. You were. And someone else felt it too.**

---

I’ve come to realise that music often knows how I feel before I do.

There have been moments where a song undid me—completely.  
Where I found myself crying, or aching, or remembering something I didn’t know I’d buried.  
Not because the lyrics told me to. But because something inside the sound *mirrored* something inside me.

> Music doesn’t need explanation.  
It bypasses logic and goes straight to the place where the soul lives.

Looking back now, I see how devastatingly lonely my childhood really was.

I used to **dance to keep from falling apart**.  
I used to **convince myself I was loved when my body knew I wasn’t**.  
And sometimes, I lost my sanity trying to maintain that illusion.

But music…  
Music remembered what I couldn’t.  
It held it for me until I was ready to return to it with more compassion.

---

Music is a kind of time-travel.  
It brings up memories held in my nervous system long before I had the tools to understand them.  
And when I’m drawn to a certain song—especially one I loop endlessly—I ask:

- *What is this reflecting back to me?*  
- *What part of me is being seen right now?*  
- *What’s surfacing that I haven’t said out loud?*

---

It turns out this isn’t just personal—it’s primal.

Science now confirms what we’ve always known intuitively:  
Music activates the emotional centres of the brain.  
It bypasses the rational mind and goes straight to the limbic system, where feeling lives.  
It allows what’s *true*—but perhaps *unspoken*—to rise to the surface.

> Music can act like a mirror.  
And sometimes, it reflects the parts of us that haven’t been fully seen.

---

So no—music didn’t fix me.  
But it **sat beside me in silence**.  
It **held me without needing me to make sense**.  
It said, quietly:  
> *“You’re not alone in this.”*

And sometimes, that was enough.

---

Because music is older than shame.  
Older than suppression.  
Older than forgetting.

It’s a rhythm that reminds us we’re still here.  
That we’ve always been here.  
And that our feelings are worth listening to.

So if you’ve ever had a moment where a song finds you—really finds you—don’t rush past it.

Let it speak.

It might be saying what you’ve been carrying all along.
