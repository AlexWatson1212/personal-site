There’s a part of me that used to flinch at criticism.

Someone didn’t like how I spoke.  
Didn’t understand my choices.  
Didn’t respond the way I hoped—and suddenly, I’d question everything.

But I’ve done too much inner work now to hand my worth to strangers.

**My worth isn’t up for debate.**

It’s not something someone else gets to give—or take away.  
It’s not dependent on praise, validation, or how many people approve.

It’s rooted in how I show up when no one’s watching.  
How I treat people who can’t give me anything.  
How I choose integrity even when it’s hard.

And on the days I forget that?  
I come back to this truth:

Someone else’s discomfort with my authenticity is *their* work, not mine.

I don’t need to shrink to soothe them.

I just need to keep standing in who I am—with quiet, grounded strength.

That’s enough.

And so am I.
