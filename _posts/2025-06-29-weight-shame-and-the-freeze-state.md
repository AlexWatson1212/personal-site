description: When your body is low on energy and stuck in a freeze state, coping mechanisms often take over â€” and that can impact how you see yourself. Here's my honest reflection from the middle of that process.
emotions: ["shame", "acceptance"]

One of the things Iâ€™ve been quietly struggling with is how difficult it is to manage my coping mechanisms when Iâ€™m in a low-energy state â€” and how thatâ€™s been affecting how I feel about my body.

Iâ€™ve put on quite a lot of weight recently.  
And while I can hold it with some compassion, I wonâ€™t lie: itâ€™s affected my self-esteem.

## ðŸ§  When the Body Canâ€™t Recharge

Iâ€™ve been in a kind of chronic low-energy mode.  
My nervous system is tired. My body battery rarely hits full.  
And no matter how much space or autonomy I have, I canâ€™t seem to recharge the way I hoped.

Thatâ€™s when the cravings come in.  
The need for quick comfort.  
The old coping tools: food, distraction, soothing through consumption.

Not because Iâ€™m lazy.  
But because Iâ€™m trying to survive â€” and sometimes, *thatâ€™s the only thing my body knows how to reach for* when I have nothing left to give.

## ðŸ”„ Itâ€™s Not About the Food

This isnâ€™t really about food or weight.  
Itâ€™s about **how hard it is to be with myself** when my body doesnâ€™t feel like mine.

Itâ€™s about how easy it is to spiral â€” from discomfort into shame, from shame into isolation, from isolation into more coping.

Itâ€™s about how even though I know the mechanisms,  
and I know the roots (trauma, abandonment, nervous system overload) â€”  
**I still find myself reaching for something I donâ€™t really want**, but donâ€™t yet know how to replace.

## ðŸ§­ A Gentle Reframe

What I keep reminding myself is:

- I am not failing â€” I am healing.  
- This isnâ€™t regression â€” itâ€™s a **freeze state** thatâ€™s asking for tenderness, not discipline.  
- My worth is not dictated by how my body looks during this phase.  
- I donâ€™t need to shame myself into change â€” I need to stay beside myself through the process.

Because this part is hard.  
And it would be so easy to give up on myself again.  
But I wonâ€™t.

## ðŸ’¬ If You're Here Too

If your weight has changed.  
If your self-esteem has dipped.  
If youâ€™re doing your best to hold it all together but feel like youâ€™re falling apart quietly...

You're not alone.  
You're not broken.  
You're just in the middle â€”  
and the middle *isn't meant to be pretty*.  
It's meant to be real.
