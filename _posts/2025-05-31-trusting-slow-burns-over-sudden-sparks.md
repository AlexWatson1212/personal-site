I used to chase the spark.

That instant connection. The rush of being seen. The intensity that made everything else fade away.

It felt like love—but often, it was a nervous system high. A collision of unmet needs. A flare that burned bright and fast, but rarely lasted.

Now, I’m learning to trust the *slow burn*.

The kind that starts quietly. Where safety builds gradually. Where mutual effort replaces emotional fireworks. Where I don’t feel a need to prove or perform.

Slow burns grow stronger with time.  
They’re based in consistency, not chaos.  
They feel like warmth—not wildfire.

It’s a different kind of excitement. More grounded. More sustainable.

And I’m starting to see that the relationships worth keeping often begin this way—not with a bang, but with a steady light I learn to trust.

That’s what I’m open to now.

Not intensity.  
But intimacy.
