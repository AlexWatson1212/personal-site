Sometimes, when things are finally going well… I tense up.

Like I’m waiting for the other shoe to drop.  
As if peace can’t last.  
As if love will vanish.  
As if I have to stay ready for loss—because hope feels dangerous.

But I’m starting to rewrite that.

**It’s safe to let good things in.**

It’s safe to feel happy and not sabotage it.  
It’s safe to trust love without preparing for heartbreak.  
It’s safe to succeed without assuming it will all slip away.

Yes, things might change.  
Yes, loss is part of life.

But so is joy.  
So is connection.  
So is abundance.

And I won’t protect myself from pain by rejecting what feels good.

Not anymore.

I’m learning to open.

To receive.  
To breathe it in.  
To *let it be good.*

Because I deserve that.

And I’m finally ready to believe it.
