There’s a pain in me that words can barely hold.  
It’s not just anger anymore. It’s not even just betrayal.  
It’s **grief** — deep, old, and frightening.

Because it’s not just that my mother hurt me.  
It’s that she shaped how others saw me.  
She manipulated the narrative so tightly that I lost access to my own reflection.  
She dimmed my light, not by yelling, but by **editing me out of my own life.**

And I played the role she assigned — unsure, ashamed, always second-guessing myself.

---

Now I see it.  
And I hate her for it.  
But more than that, **I mourn what it cost me**.

Because I don’t know who I might have been if I hadn’t grown up beneath her shadow.  
And that truth hurts more than anything.

I can say it aloud now:  
> She didn’t just hurt me — she *colonised* me.

She didn’t just take control of my childhood.  
She took control of **how I was allowed to exist in the world.**

And now that I see it, I feel this wave rising behind the anger — this tidal wave of sadness so vast that I don’t know how to hold it.  
I’m scared of what it might do if I let it all the way in.

But maybe that’s the next part of healing.  
Not fixing it.  
Not conquering it.  
Just **sitting near it**.  
Letting it have space.

Letting myself feel *some* of what was never safe to feel before.

Because beneath all the rage, all the defiance, all the boundary-setting… there’s still that part of me asking:

> “Why didn’t I get a mum who loved me?”

And that’s the heartbreak I keep circling.  
And maybe — just maybe — I’m strong enough now to feel it.

Not all at once.

But enough to honour it.

Enough to **stop running from it**.

Enough to begin.
