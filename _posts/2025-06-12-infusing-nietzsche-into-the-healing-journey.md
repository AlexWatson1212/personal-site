There’s a strange energy in the air when you finally walk away from the people who conditioned you — especially when those people were your family.

In the silence that follows, there’s space.  
And in that space, I find myself reaching for voices that don’t sugarcoat the pain, but also don’t flinch from the power it holds.  

One of those voices for me has been **Friedrich Nietzsche**.

If I were to take his ideas and infuse them into my life right now — in this raw, in-between, rebuilding place — these are the ones that resonate.  
Maybe they’ll resonate for you too.

## 🗿 1. *Become Who You Are*

This one hits different when you’ve been shaped by narcissistic conditioning.  
I spent years trying to be *good*. Accommodating. Acceptable.

Now?  
I want to be **real**.

> “Become who you are! Do what only you can do. Be the master and the sculptor of yourself.”

It’s a daily invitation to peel back the layers that were never really me — and to stop apologizing for the fire that’s been buried underneath.

## 🌑 2. *Let Chaos Be Sacred*

Sometimes I still feel overwhelmed — the weight, the exhaustion, the cravings, the grief.  
But Nietzsche reframes that chaos as necessary. Not as a flaw, but as fuel.

> “One must still have chaos in oneself to give birth to a dancing star.”

I’m learning not to rush past the mess.  
To sit in it. To breathe in it.  
Because maybe this isn’t a breakdown — maybe it’s a **birth**.

## 🧍‍♂️ 3. *Obey Yourself Now*

I’m no longer under my mother’s rule, or anyone else’s script.  
But that also means I need to learn to follow something deeper — *my own soul*.

> “He who cannot obey himself will be commanded.”

That looks like eating what truly nourishes me. Saying no.  
Honouring when I’m exhausted instead of overriding myself.

> “No price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.”

And I’m paying that price. Willingly.

## ⚔️ 4. *Live Dangerously*

Not in a reckless way — but in a way that lets me **lean into life**.  
Speak my truth. Create something that matters.  
Even if it’s quiet. Even if no one sees it but me.

> “The secret of reaping the greatest fruitfulness and the greatest enjoyment from life is to live dangerously!”

For me, that might be filming a video in Norway.  
Or writing honestly.  
Or showing up to the day with nothing to prove.

---

## 🐍 5. *Shed or Die*

There’s an old identity falling away:  
The boy who tolerated too much.  
The man who kept the peace to stay connected.  
The version of me who coped by overeating and staying small.

> “The snake that cannot shed its skin must perish.”

I’m shedding. It’s painful. But it’s *working*.  
Something new is being revealed.

## 🧠 A Few Truths I’m Carrying Forward

- You don’t need to be understood by the people you left behind.
- You are allowed to choose silence over performance.
- Solitude can be fertile ground.
- You’re not meant to stay a caterpillar out of guilt that the others won’t fly.

> *“Do not pity yourself. Marvel at yourself.”*

I’m trying.

This healing isn’t linear.  
But it is **real**.

And if you’re here too — rebuilding, unraveling, reclaiming — then maybe you’re not falling apart.  
Maybe you’re just becoming.

And Nietzsche, in all his raw, unfiltered brilliance, might have smiled at that.
