> “Meaning is not something given to us. It is something we are challenged to create.” — James Hollis

No one is coming to tell me what my life means.  
There’s no grand voice from the sky, no perfect mentor who can hand me a script.

And maybe that’s the hardest truth of all:
I’m responsible for what I make of this.

Not just in a self-help kind of way.  
But in the quiet, daily choices —  
- The meaning I make of pain.  
- The stories I carry forward.  
- The ones I finally choose to put down.

This chapter hit me right where I live right now.  
Because so much has fallen away — the people I thought might walk with me, the institutions I hoped might recognize me, the familiar structures I used to cling to.

And now, it’s just me.  
Standing in the rubble, still willing to build something real.

I’ve been waiting for life to show me the path.  
But maybe the truth is — I *am* the path.  
Every act of honesty. Every step toward integrity. Every time I choose rest instead of self-erasure. That’s me making meaning out of everything that’s come before.

The ache I feel isn’t just grief — it’s *possibility*.  
And it’s mine to shape.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
What story am I currently telling about my life?  
And if I fully owned that story — what would I change, claim, or create next?
