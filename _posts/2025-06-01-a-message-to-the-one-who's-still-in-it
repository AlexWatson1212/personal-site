# A Message to the One Who’s Still in It

If you’re reading this in the middle of the storm — when nothing makes sense, and it feels like no one really sees you — this is for you.

Not the polished version of you.  
Not the version that "has it all figured out."  
Just *you* — hurting, heavy, hidden. Trying to get through.

I’ve been there.

## I Know What It Feels Like

To be used by your own family — the ones meant to protect you.  
To be dismissed by a partner who promised to care.  
To walk through your own front door and feel like a stranger in your own life.  
To be surrounded by people, yet still feel **utterly alone**.  
To reach for help and find no hand there.  
To want out — not because you hate life, but because it hurts too much to keep walking through it without hope.

I know what it feels like to carry all of that **with no one to witness it**.  
To feel like maybe you're the problem.  
To wonder if you're just too sensitive, too broken, too needy, too much.

You're not.  
Let me say that again:

> **You’re not the problem.**

## The Truth Is — You Were Abandoned

Not because you were unworthy.  
But because the people around you were too emotionally immature, wounded, or self-absorbed to *see* you properly.

You weren’t too messy.  
They were just too disconnected from their own pain to meet yours.

You weren’t unlovable.  
You were just asking for real connection in a world where most people are terrified of it.

You weren’t asking for too much.  
You were asking for the **bare minimum** — to be heard, seen, held.

And when no one gives that to you — over years, decades — it starts to eat away at your sense of reality.

## I Thought I Was Strong for Surviving — I Was

But I also thought I had to *hide everything* to survive.  
That if I didn’t keep it all together, no one would stay.  
That if I didn’t smile through the wreckage, no one would care.

And now? I see the real strength wasn’t in suppressing the pain — it was in *finally facing it.*

It was in choosing to feel it.  
To grieve what I never got.  
To accept that I wasn’t crazy — I was **deeply, heartbreakingly alone**, and trying to make sense of a world that didn’t make space for me.

## You Don’t Need to Be Fixed

You don’t need another self-improvement plan.  
You don’t need to become more palatable, more likable, more “together.”

You just need someone to say:

> “I see you.  
> I believe you.  
> It makes sense that you feel this way.  
> You’re not alone.”  

That’s what I’m saying to you now.

## This Isn’t the End of Your Story

I created *Embracing Authenticity* as a way to document my healing. But really, I created it for people like you — the ones **still in it**.

Still doubting their worth.  
Still picking up the pieces.  
Still holding their breath, waiting for someone to care.

You don’t need to wait anymore.  
You can care for *yourself* now.  
And you can let this space be a quiet reminder that even in your darkest moments, you are not forgotten.

## Just a Glimmer

Sometimes, that’s all we need.  
Not a full rescue. Not a perfect fix.  
Just a **glimmer**.

A moment where something soft breaks through the fog and whispers:

> “Keep going. You’re doing better than you think.”

That’s all this post is.  
A glimmer.

And if it reaches even one person who’s still in it — then all of my pain, all the years I spent lost and alone — will have been worth it.

Because you’re worth it.

*With all my heart,  
From someone who made it out — and is still making it through.*
