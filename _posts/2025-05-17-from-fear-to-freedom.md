I’ve been carrying this invisible weight — the fear that if I live too freely, spend too boldly, or choose too loudly, someone might come and try to take it all back.

Someone being her.

Even though an email confirmed it was a gift.  
Even though I’ve built a life apart.  
Even though I know the truth.

There was still that lingering fear, the echo of my mother’s voice — unpredictable, controlling, vindictive — echoing in the corners of my mind. It made it hard to enjoy what I had. To trust what was mine.

So I called a lawyer.  
Just to be sure.

And you know what? That call — short, free, and probably unremarkable to them — was *healing* for me. Because they said what my adult self already knew:

> “If it was a gift, and there's evidence of that, she can’t take it back.”

And something in me softened.  

I realised I’m safe.  
I’m free.  
I don’t need to stay small anymore just to protect myself from an imagined threat.

Now, I get to re-floor the house.  
Choose a sofa I actually love.  
Make my space feel like mine — because it *is* mine.

And worst-case scenario? Even if something unexpected came up, I’m still secure. I’ve got savings, investments, backup plans. My adult self has built something real and steady.

This isn’t about revenge.  
It’s about reclaiming my life — quietly, steadily, and with love.

I’m not waiting for permission anymore.  
I’m home.
