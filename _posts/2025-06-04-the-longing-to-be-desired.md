description: Exploring the quiet ache of wanting to be desired — and why it’s not something to be ashamed of.
emotions: [longing, shame]

There’s a part of me I don’t often talk about.

The part that longs to be desired — not just liked, not just accepted — but *truly wanted*. The kind of desire that doesn’t just tolerate your presence but lights up at the sight of you. That leans in. That lingers.

For a long time, I told myself I didn’t need that. That I was above it, or beyond it, or better off without it. But that wasn’t the truth. That was the survival story I had to write when I wasn’t being mirrored back as worthy. When desire felt unsafe. When I associated wanting with rejection.

So I suppressed it.  
And in its place, I became “nice.”  
I became “safe.”  
I became someone who could never be rejected — but also, someone who rarely got to be fully seen.

Recently, I’ve started to realise that this part of me — the part that wants to feel *wanted* — isn’t weak. It’s not shameful. It’s not manipulative or selfish.  
It’s sacred.

It’s the part of me that still believes intimacy could be mutual. That someone could see me — *truly* see me — and not flinch. That desire could exist without danger. That I wouldn’t be abandoned for being too much, or shamed for being vulnerable, or punished for being real.

That feels like healing.

And yes, it’s scary.  
Yes, I still feel the echoes of old wounds.  
But I’m starting to notice: the more I allow myself to feel that desire — without judgment — the more human I feel. The more whole I feel.

This isn't about rushing into connection. It's not about needing someone to fill a gap. It's about reclaiming a part of myself I once buried to survive.

I want to be desired.  
And that’s okay.

Maybe you do too.  
And maybe it’s time we stop pretending otherwise.

*Sometimes the most radical thing we can do is admit we want to be wanted — and then, lovingly, want ourselves first.*
