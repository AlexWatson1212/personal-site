There’s something different about how I’m approaching this next chapter.  

I’m not walking into Level 4 with the same urgency I used to carry — the drive to prove, to be understood, or to make something happen quickly. For the first time in a long while, I feel like I can let things take the time they need.

A two-year course means more space — not just to learn, but to actually connect. Slowly. Honestly. Without forcing anything.

It feels like a soft opportunity to let relationships *grow* rather than *grasp* at them. And that in itself is healing.

The smaller class size helps too. Less performance. More presence. A chance to show up as I am — not the polished version, not the version with all the answers, just me.

And that feels enough.

There’s something quietly hopeful about walking alongside others who are also choosing this path — not out of obligation, but because it resonates.  

Maybe that’s the most profound thing: realizing that I don’t need to be “ready” or “finished” to connect. I just need to be here. Willing. Present. And trusting that who I am — as I am — is enough to be met.

A slow path.  
But a true one.
