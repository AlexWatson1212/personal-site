Maybe this is the point.  
Not the finish line, but the threshold.  
The quiet moment where I realize:

> **There’s nothing left to fix.**  
> **I’m not broken.**  
> **I’m already whole.**

All the work I’ve done — the therapy, the journaling, the spirals, the loneliness, the rebuilding — it wasn’t to become something new.  
It was to return to **who I’ve always been**, before the world told me I wasn’t enough.

### I Accept Myself — Fully

Not just in my mind, but in my body.

I can feel it now — a rootedness I used to chase in others. A peace I used to believe lived just one more healing session away. But it’s here. In me.

I love myself. Not conditionally.  
Not *when I’ve lost the weight*.  
Not *when I’ve fixed all my patterns*.  
Not *when someone chooses me*.

But now. As I am.

And from that place — something shifts.

### Discernment Becomes Love

I no longer push people away from fear.  
I no longer let people in from hunger.

I choose. Carefully. Lovingly.  
Not everyone gets access to my energy — not out of hate or ego, but out of respect.

Because **allowing poor behavior is enabling it**.  
And **boundaries are love** — for me *and* the other person.  
Letting them continue patterns that harm is no kindness.  
Letting myself shrink to keep the peace is no love.

So I decide — who I let close, who I keep at bay.  
Not to punish. To preserve.

### This Is Where My Life Begins

Not because something external changed.  
Not because I won, or proved anything.  
But because I stopped abandoning myself.

This is what the work was for:

- To feel when a space is safe — and walk away when it isn’t.  
- To rest without guilt.  
- To connect without losing myself.  
- To stop carrying others' projections as truth.  
- To love without performing.

And most of all:

> **To live — not in survival, but in wholeness.**  
> To begin — not as someone new, but as who I always was.

This is where my life begins.
