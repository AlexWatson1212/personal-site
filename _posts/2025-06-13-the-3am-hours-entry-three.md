excerpt: "In the quiet of the early hours, I've learned that my truest connection is with myself—and that's more than enough."

It’s another early hour.

I’ve been thinking—well, feeling really—that I don’t have any friends or family right now. And yet… it doesn’t feel tragic. It doesn’t even feel particularly sad.

Because I have something else.  
I have my purpose.  
I have my son.  
I have enough connection in my life to make it meaningful.  
And I have *me*.

That used to feel like a backup plan. Now, it feels like the centrepiece.

Everything else is a bonus.  
And there’s a beauty in that.

I’m not afraid to start again—financially, socially, emotionally. Even if I lost what little connection I currently have, I think I’d be okay. Health matters. Sanity matters. And I know those things can waver.

But what feels most important is this:  
As long as I can return to myself—  
to my sense of who I am,  
to the good, the bad, the ugly—  
I’ll be okay.

Because that relationship, the one I have with myself, is real now. It’s honest. It’s lived in.

This isn’t resignation.  
This is freedom.
