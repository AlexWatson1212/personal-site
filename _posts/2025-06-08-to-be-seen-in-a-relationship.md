We often talk about wanting to be loved.  
But more than that — *we want to be seen.*

Not for the roles we play.  
Not for the things we do.  
But for who we *are* beneath all of it.

### 👁 What It Means to Be Seen

Being seen isn’t about someone knowing your favorite food or remembering your birthday.  
It’s when someone *gets* the way your silence isn’t coldness — it’s retreat.  
It’s when someone notices your nervous laugh and understands what it’s protecting.  
It’s when you don’t have to explain every inch of yourself, because they’re not trying to *fix* you — they’re just trying to meet you.

To be seen is to feel safe in your truth.  
Not because it’s perfect — but because it’s *welcome*.

### 🔍 What It’s Not

Being seen is not being constantly evaluated.  
It’s not walking on eggshells, hoping the other person understands your heart behind every mistake.  
It’s not needing to prove your goodness or justify your needs.

If you’re always explaining, defending, or shrinking —  
you’re not being seen.  
You’re being misunderstood through a lens that was never about *you* to begin with.

### 🤝 Mutual Seeing

The most beautiful relationships aren’t built on constant agreement — they’re built on **mutual willingness to see**.

To slow down.  
To listen beneath the words.  
To be curious, not controlling.  
To hold difference without withdrawing love.

When someone sees you *and stays* — not because they need you to change, but because they want to know you deeper — that's where connection becomes healing.

### 🌱 An Ongoing Practice

To be seen isn’t just something someone else gives you.  
It’s something you give yourself, too.

You begin by seeing your own patterns.  
Your own projections.  
Your own fears.

And as you learn to sit with them gently — you’ll stop demanding others do what you’ve never practiced inside.

Then when someone *does* meet you… you’ll recognize it.  
And more importantly — you’ll be ready to receive it.

Being seen is rare.  
But not impossible.  
And once you feel it, truly — you’ll never again settle for anything less.
