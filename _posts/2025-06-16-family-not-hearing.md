Lately, I’ve been noticing something — especially with my cousin and my uncle.  
**Every time I make a light-hearted joke, it somehow turns into a problem.**

Recently, they were saying how good my cousin used to be at football, and that he even kept a photo of himself in his pocket. I said something like,  
> *“You carry that around just in case someone needs proof you played?”*

It wasn’t meant to be cruel. It wasn’t even a serious dig.  
But the reaction I got? Offended. Cold. Like I’d just stepped out of line.  
And it made me think: *maybe my jokes aren’t being received as jokes.*

But then again, maybe they’re not just jokes.  
Maybe they’re me trying to tell the truth in the only way I know how.  
Maybe they’re little expressions of resentment that I haven’t even fully processed.

Because the reality is — my cousin has never once reached out to me. Not in my darkest moments. Not ever.  
There’s no real relationship there. No effort. No warmth.  
And yet somehow, when I make a passing joke, *I’m the one who’s done something wrong*.

Same thing with my uncle. He kept interrogating me:  
> “What are you doing with your life?”  
> “Where are you working?”  
> “What’s going on?”

Like he was waiting to catch me out.  
Like my life was something he had the right to inspect.

And all I could say, over and over again, was:
> *“I’m doing really well, mate. Don’t worry about it.”*

I didn’t snap. I didn’t lash out. But the truth?  
He annoys the hell out of me. I hope I never see him again.  
Not because I’m full of rage — but because I’m done explaining myself to people who don’t actually care.

And maybe that’s the realisation beneath all of this:

> I’ve spent years trying to belong in a family that doesn’t really *see* me.  
> Trying to connect with people who don’t want to hear me — not really.

They’re not interested in who I am.  
They’re more invested in who they *think* I should be.  
And when I step outside of that — with honesty, humour, emotion — I’m labelled as too much, too sensitive, too rude.

But I’m not any of those things.  
I’m just **done pretending**.

There *is* one cousin I’ve always felt a level of connection with.  
Every time we’ve met, he’s the one I’ve talked to most. We’ve had things in common. We’ve shared a bit more than surface-level.  
But he’s never reached out. Not once.  
He’s ten years older than me, and it’s always felt like the invitation — if it were real — should’ve come from him. But it never did. Just more of the same:  
> *“Yeah yeah, come up sometime.”*

Empty invites. Words with no weight. I don’t have time for that anymore.  
Now that I’ve experienced even a glimpse of *real* connection, I know the difference.  
And I’m not chasing after **shitty relationships**, even if they’re family.

Honestly?  
I’ve had better conversations — better connection — with strangers I meet walking my dog than I’ve ever had with my extended family. And that may be a sad truth, but it’s mine. And it’s honest.

Maybe I’ve never really belonged there.  
Maybe I was never meant to.

But I belong here. In this truth.  
And I’m not watering it down to keep anyone else comfortable.
