Description: Sitting in the doorway of uncertainty — unsure if I was overlooked or undermined, but certain that I’m not going backwards.

There’s a moment I keep coming back to —  
the moment where I wonder if I was wrong.

Maybe it wasn’t personal.  
Maybe there *wasn’t* a place on Level 4.  
Maybe I *did* talk too much in the listening exercises.  
Maybe my intuition about the power dynamics… was off.

But then I remember what actually happened.  
The way things were said. The way they were *done.*  
The joy I saw in a tutor’s eyes when I went into an interview that made no sense for me to be in.  
The feedback brought up in front of an entire class without invitation — not as support, but as some kind of subtle exposure.  
The “you would’ve reacted before” comment, as if orchestrating a trigger was her version of helping me grow.

And the truth is — I handled it all.  
I stayed composed. I asserted soft boundaries.  
I showed up every week and took the work seriously.  
No missteps. No outbursts. No instability.  
Just the quiet kind of strength that often goes unnoticed.

So which is it?

Was I being tested… or dismissed?  
Were they trying to help me grow… or hoping I’d crack?

I honestly don’t know.  
And maybe I never will.

But what I do know is this:

If my intuition *was* right — then it wasn’t safe for me there.  
And if my intuition *wasn’t* right — then it still wasn’t safe, because no one bothered to check in, clarify, or offer repair.

And either way — I’ve grown more in this tension than I ever would’ve on that course.

So I’ve applied elsewhere.  
I’ve let go of trying to prove anything.  
And I’m leaning even deeper into who I am, because I finally trust it.

The question I used to ask was:  
**What if I’m wrong about them?**  
But now I ask something far more important:

**What if I’m finally right about me?**
