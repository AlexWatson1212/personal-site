Tonight, I almost didn't go. My body battery was at 39%, I’d been emotionally processing all day, and there was part of me that felt heavy — maybe from the cake, maybe from the day itself. I had a headache, I felt lethargic, and I wasn’t entirely sure if a run would help or hinder.

But something deeper said, _“Wait until it cools, have something light, and then move gently.”_  
So I did.

I waited. I ate a little. I laced up.  
And I ran.

It wasn’t fast. It wasn’t about pushing. It was a 45-minute jog at Zone 2, with a few moments dipping into Zone 3. Enough to get my blood moving, but not enough to tip me into exhaustion. When I checked my watch after, I saw I’d only used 6–7% of my body battery. That small detail felt like a win — a sign that I’d hit the sweet spot.

It was the right decision.  
Sometimes it won’t be.  
But this time, it was.

There’s something about movement that doesn’t just regulate the body — it resets the mind. It’s not about discipline or performance. It’s about tuning in. Listening. And tonight, I listened well.

**Running didn’t drain me. It brought me home.**
