Sometimes I don’t feel like a good enough father.

I look at my life — I’m still overweight, I don’t have a traditional job, I’m not exactly the picture of stability the world tends to paint when it comes to parenthood. I catch myself thinking things like, *“Is this the example I’m setting?”* And it stings.  

That voice — the one that asks those questions — is the critical parent in me. It’s the part that remembers all the times I fell short, all the times I hoped for support and didn’t get it, all the times I thought love was something I had to *earn*. It’s the part that doesn’t believe a different story is possible, because so far, the evidence has been thin.

But here’s the truth I’m starting to let in — slowly, gently, with practice:

I *am* working toward something.  
I’m two years away from being qualified as a counsellor.  
And I will be very good at it — not in spite of my journey, but *because* of it.  
I’ll know how to sit with people because I’ve learned to sit with myself.  

I also make money from poker — not just a hobby, but a legitimate skill I’ve cultivated through patience, analysis, and emotional regulation. Between the two — counselling and poker — I’m building a life that fits me. One I don’t have to escape from.

More than that:  
I’ve started to create a foundation of *secure connection*.  
Something I never had. Something I didn’t even know how to name until therapy showed me.  
And I’m learning to carry that out into the world — to meet people from a place of grounded self-respect instead of need.

I may not have it all figured out.  
But I *have* something I never did before:  
a deep sense of **self-respect** that can’t be overturned.  

I’m proud of that.  
And I’m proud of myself for being able to say that out loud.

Because even just a few years ago, I would’ve stopped at the criticism. I would’ve let that voice run the show. But now I let it speak — and then I *speak back*.

I’m not a perfect parent. No one is.  
And given where I’ve come from — what I’ve carried — I think *being a good enough parent* is not only enough…  
It’s extraordinary.

I don’t always feel like I’m doing well.  
But feelings aren’t facts.  
And when I look at my son — at the calm in our home, at the way I talk to him, sit with him, protect him, repair with him — I know I’m doing something powerful.  

Something I never received.  
Something that is healing both of us, day by day.

And maybe that’s what fatherhood really is —  
Not a flawless performance,  
But a commitment to keep showing up,  
Even when you’re still learning how to love yourself.

That’s what I’m doing.  
And it’s enough.
