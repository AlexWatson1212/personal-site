This year won’t be about achievement.  
It won’t be about proving anything to anyone.  
Not to tutors. Not to institutions. Not even to myself.

This is the year I let the slow burn happen.

I’ve chosen not to return to a place that couldn’t see me.  
And for the first time in years, I’m not carrying the full weight of daily parenting.  
Right now, I have 30% of that responsibility — and while I still show up as a father with love and presence, I finally have *space* to breathe.

And I don’t need to fill it.  
I just need to **inhabit** it.

There’s no urgency anymore. No frantic grasping for identity.  
I’m not abandoning myself to stay afloat.

Instead, I’m staying still — and letting the fire of becoming do its quiet work.

---

This isn’t the year I collapse.  
It’s the year I **integrate**.  
The year I choose slow over spectacle.  
Truth over timelines.

And I don’t know what it will become —  
But I trust that something real is taking shape beneath the silence.

So I’ll rest. I’ll write. I’ll feel.  
And I’ll let the slow burn reshape me.
