For a long time, I confused people-pleasing with keeping the peace.

I thought saying “yes” was kindness.  
I thought staying quiet was mature.  
I thought not making waves made me easy to love.

But what I was really doing was abandoning myself.

Because peace that comes at the cost of your truth isn’t peace—it’s performance.  
It’s a nervous system trying to avoid conflict.  
It’s a survival strategy that says: *Keep them happy so you don’t get hurt.*

Now, I’m learning the difference.

**Peace is rooted in mutual respect.**  
People-pleasing is rooted in fear.

Peace includes me.  
People-pleasing erases me.

And I deserve to be part of the peace I’m protecting.

So now I speak up—even if my voice shakes.  
I say no—even if it disappoints someone.  
I choose alignment over approval.

That’s not conflict. That’s clarity.
