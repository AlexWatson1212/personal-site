There are moments when I feel the urge to chase.

Chase a message. Chase a connection. Chase validation. Chase the feeling that I matter.

And when that urge rises, it’s loud. It feels urgent. Like I *need* to act on it immediately or I’ll lose something forever.

But I’m starting to slow down and ask:

> “What am I really chasing right now?”

More often than not, it’s not the person or situation in front of me—it’s a feeling I didn’t get somewhere else. An old unmet need. A version of me still waiting to be chosen.

So I pause.

I breathe.

And I remind myself:
- If it’s real, I won’t have to chase it.
- If it’s mutual, I won’t have to convince anyone.
- If it’s meant, it will meet me halfway.

This is how I’m unlearning pursuit as proof of worth.

This is how I’m letting myself *be chosen*—without performing, pleasing, or proving.

And some days, that choice changes everything.
