At some point, I internalised the idea that I was too much.

Too emotional.  
Too deep.  
Too intense with my thoughts, my heart, my hope for connection.

So I’d water myself down.  
Speak less.  
Feel less.  
Need less.

All to avoid the risk of being left.

But I know better now.

**I am not too much for the right person.**

The right person will lean in, not back away.  
They’ll meet my depth with depth of their own.  
They’ll appreciate the layers, not try to peel them off or paint over them.

I don’t need to hide to be chosen.

And I don’t want to be loved for a version of me that isn’t whole.

So I’ll keep showing up — as I am.

Full-hearted. Curious. Caring.

And I’ll trust that anyone who finds that overwhelming… simply isn’t for me.

Not because I’m too much.

But because they’re not ready for what I offer.
