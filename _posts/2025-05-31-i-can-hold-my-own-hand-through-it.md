There are moments when I wish someone would just see it.

See what I’m carrying.  
Understand what I’m feeling — without me needing to explain it.  
Sit next to me and say, *“You don’t have to hold this alone.”*

And maybe, one day, someone will.

But until then, I’m learning something powerful:

**I can hold my own hand through it.**

I can speak to myself with gentleness.  
I can remind myself I’m doing my best.  
I can take a walk, breathe, cry, or rest — not to fix it, but to be present with it.

That presence means something.

It tells the younger parts of me that I won’t abandon them now.  
That I don’t need to wait for rescue.  
That I’ve become the kind of man who can sit with pain *without* shutting down.

And that’s the real healing.

Not needing to be fixed — just needing to be held.

Even if I’m the one doing the holding.  
**Especially** then.
