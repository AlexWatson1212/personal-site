There’s no step between the living room and kitchen, and there’s no water damage. But still, the floors aren’t level, and it needs to be done properly.

It might cost between four and seven grand all in, including skirting boards. That’s not nothing. But I can handle that — even if I won’t be thrilled about spending it. I’ll get some quotes and go from there. The truth is, they do this day in, day out. They’ll know exactly what needs doing, and it’ll be done to a standard I just can’t reach on my own.

And I’ve realised that’s okay.

Trying to do it all myself — just to save money or prove something — isn’t always the best route. Especially when it comes to things that matter long-term. Proper flooring impacts the feel of the house, the resale value, and my everyday sense of space. Doing it right matters.

This isn’t just about flooring.

It’s about accepting that I’m worth doing things properly for. That I don’t need to prove my ability by stretching myself thin. I’m not a floor-fitter. I never have been. And expecting myself to deliver something to a professional standard, when it’s not my trade, just isn’t fair.

Getting this done professionally is a step toward self-love. It’s a quiet but real declaration: _I’m worth the care._  
My home is worth it.  
My peace is worth it.

So yeah — I’ll leave this one to the pros. And I’ll let myself breathe a little more because of it.
