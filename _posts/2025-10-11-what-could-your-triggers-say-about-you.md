We’re often told to manage or avoid our triggers.  
To control them, suppress them, or treat them as signs of weakness.  

But what if triggers are not flaws at all?  

What if they’re mirrors?  

What if every moment of frustration or shame is a signal — showing you not just where you hurt, but also what you most deeply value?

Carl Rogers taught that our lived experience is the most trustworthy guide we have.  
Carl Jung reminded us that what irritates or unsettles us in others often reveals an unowned part of ourselves.  
Irvin Yalom spoke about discomfort as a doorway to truth, and Transactional Analysis frames triggers as the Child within us calling out for care from our Adult or Nurturing Parent.  

When I hold these ideas together, something shifts:  
My triggers stop being proof that I’m broken, and start becoming signposts pointing me home.

### 🔍 From Trigger → Value  

**When I feel ignored, unseen, or dismissed**  
→ It shows I value **being recognised, respected, and truly seen**.  

**When someone crosses my boundaries or sends mixed signals**  
→ It shows I value **safety, clarity, and mutual respect**.  

**When people are distant, unavailable, or don’t respond**  
→ It shows I value **consistent connection and emotional availability**.  

**When authority or systems feel rigid, cold, or hypocritical**  
→ It shows I value **authenticity, fairness, and integrity**.  

**When I feel exposed, judged, or vulnerable in groups**  
→ It shows I value **courageous authenticity and being met with compassion**.  

**When someone demands my energy without reciprocity**  
→ It shows I value **balance and mutual care in relationships**.

The reframe is simple but powerful:  
My triggers are not shameful weaknesses.  
They are reminders of what matters to me.  

> The sting is a compass, pointing to my deepest values.  

So now, when a trigger flares, I pause and ask myself:  

*“What could this be saying about me — about my needs, my longings, my values?”*

**Your triggers aren’t there to break you.  
They’re there to guide you back to yourself.**
