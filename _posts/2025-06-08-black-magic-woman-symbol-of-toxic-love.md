What if *Black Magic Woman* isn’t just a sultry rock song with Latin flair—but a hypnotic spell about being consumed by the wrong kind of love?

Not evil love.  
Not fake love.  
But *wounded* love—the kind that feels powerful, seductive, even spiritual… until you realise it’s hollow, manipulative, and leaves you lost in yourself.

### 🎤 A Song My Dad Sang With Fire

My dad used to sing this song emphatically—like it meant something deeper than the lyrics let on.

He didn’t just sing it.  
He *inhabited* it.  
Like he knew what it meant to be caught up in someone’s spell… or maybe to cast one of his own.

Back then, I didn’t understand the words.  
But I felt the heat in his voice. The ache. The seduction. The warning.

Now I wonder if that song was echoing something unspoken in him—and if it echoed in me too.

### 🖤 “Got me so blind I can’t see…”

This is what happens when love becomes obsession.  
When someone reflects back the mystery and sensuality you crave—but also awakens your fear of abandonment, your confusion, your lack of worth.

> *"I got a black magic woman / Got me so blind I can't see..."*

He's mesmerized. Addicted. Trapped in a dance he thinks is love—but it’s really power. And he’s not the one holding it.

### 🕯 The Spell of Projection

She’s not a witch. She’s a mirror.

The *black magic woman* is symbolic—she represents all the ways we fall for **fantasy**, for **projection**, for the hope that someone else can fill the void inside us.

Sometimes, that “spell” is cast by someone who manipulates us.  
But sometimes, we cast it on ourselves—because it’s easier than facing the parts of us that feel unwanted or unloved.

### 💔 “Don’t turn your back on me, baby…”

Now he’s waking up.

The spell is breaking, but not without pain.  
He pleads. He begs. He tries to reclaim his power. But it’s messy. Because breaking free from toxic love doesn’t always feel like triumph—it can feel like grief.

> *"Stop messin' 'round with your tricks..."*

The line between seduction and sabotage gets thin when we don’t know our worth.

### 🔄 A Symbol of Emotional Entanglement

This isn’t just about a woman—it’s about **that part of you that keeps going back**, even when it hurts.

The *Black Magic Woman* is a story of entanglement.  
Of being so desperate to feel wanted that you surrender your clarity, your boundaries, your peace.

But here’s the thing:

If you can *name* it, you can *reclaim* it.

You don’t have to keep dancing with a ghost of your unmet needs.

### 🎶 The Song as a Wake-Up Call

Like all great music, Santana’s version isn’t just heard—it’s *felt*.  
It touches something primal. The ache of being spellbound by beauty and burned by the truth beneath it.

Sometimes, the most seductive songs are the ones that teach us what **not** to call love.
