I just let go of the last connection that wasn’t truly serving me. Not with hate. Not with anger. Just a quiet, final *no more*.  

It wasn't the most dramatic. It wasn’t even the most painful. But it was the *last*. And that made it symbolic. It marked the end of a cycle — the old me, the one who tolerated, who waited to be seen, who stayed loyal to people who didn’t *actually see me at all*.  

I’ve let go of them all now. My mother, and every other person whose presence kept me tied to a version of myself I’ve outgrown. Some of them once meant a lot to me. Some of them probably still care, in their own way. But none of them have grown with me. None of them could meet me where I am now. And that’s okay.  

What surprises me most is the feeling that came after. Not grief. Not guilt.  
**Excitement.**

For the first time, my life feels like it’s *mine*. My energy isn’t tied up in managing, fixing, or proving. I’ve cut the ties to people who were surprised by my clarity — and that, in itself, showed how little they really saw.

They might have meant well.  
They might have loved me in the ways they knew how.  
But I love me better now. And I get to choose what love looks like moving forward.

I know no one will clap for this moment. There’s no parade for choosing peace. No standing ovation for inner alignment. But I’m clapping. Quietly, deeply, with reverence. Because I *know* what this took.

This is the kind of freedom no one gives you.  
You have to *take* it.

And I just did.
