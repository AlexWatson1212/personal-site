I used to believe my emotions were a problem.

Too much. Too messy. Too unpredictable. Something to hide or apologise for.

Especially if they made someone else uncomfortable.

So I’d downplay what I felt. Swallow my sadness. Laugh off my anger. Numb out instead of speak up.

But that version of me was surviving—not thriving.

Now I know:

**My emotions aren’t inconvenient.**

They’re not a flaw.  
They’re not a burden.  
They’re signals. Messages. Expressions of something real inside me asking to be felt.

And I’m allowed to feel them fully—even if no one else understands them.

I don’t need to shrink to keep others comfortable.

The people meant for me won’t be scared of my depth.  
They’ll meet me there.

And more importantly—I’ll meet myself there first.
