> “The soul does not care what we believe; it cares how present we are to our own depths.” — James Hollis

This chapter gave me pause.

Because when I think of *spirituality*, I don’t think of religion.  
I think of quiet moments.  
Inner knowing.  
That flicker of something beyond the noise — something that feels like *home*.

And yet, I’ve often drifted from it.  
Not out of disbelief — but out of exhaustion.  
When I’m lonely, depleted, or overwhelmed, it’s hard to tend to the soul.

But this chapter reminds me:  
Spirituality isn’t about doing it *right*.  
It’s about staying in **relationship** with my inner life.

- Listening to dreams.  
- Honoring longings.  
- Creating space for meaning — not just survival.

It doesn’t need to look impressive.  
It just needs to be *real*.

My soul isn’t asking for ritual or perfection.  
It’s asking to be *seen* — and met with presence.

That’s what I want to return to:  
A quiet, living spirituality that holds me — even when I feel lost.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
What does “soulful living” look like for me — not in theory, but in the small, daily moments?  
Where have I been neglecting it, and how might I begin to return?
