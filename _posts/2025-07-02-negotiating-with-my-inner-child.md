I think most of my issues — maybe even all of them — stem from this ongoing negotiation with my inner child.

There’s a wounded part of me that takes the wheel a lot of the time. Not because he’s reckless, or broken, or stupid — but because **he believes no one else will protect me**. And for a long time, he was right.

The hard part is… I didn’t even realise it was him.  
I just assumed that was *me*.  
The me who got defensive.  
The me who assumed people were against me.  
The me who believed — quietly, constantly — that my needs would never be met, and that hoping otherwise was dangerous.

That strategy worked beautifully in childhood.  
It **kept me safe**.  
It made me alert, capable, self-sufficient.  

But now?  
It’s kind of ruined my life.

Not out of malice — but out of habit.  
Out of love.  
Out of survival.

And I can finally see that now.

While I genuinely appreciate the beauty of what my wounded inner child has done — and it *is* beautiful — I also know that **what protected me then is now keeping me from what I truly need.**

And so begins the work.

> Healing isn’t about suppressing the child who panics or lashes out or avoids connection.  
> It’s about negotiating with him. Over and over again.  
> Gently. Lovingly. Firmly when needed, but always with care.

It’s not a quick fix.

In fact, *assuming it will be* is probably one of the most subtle ways I sabotage myself. Healing is slow. Messy. And full of repeat lessons.

What I’m learning now is this:

> **Shaming the part of me that makes these protective decisions does not help.**  
> It only deepens the wound. It makes the child dig in harder.  
> And it confirms his fear that no one — not even me — will ever fully accept him.

So I’m learning to take a different approach.

To say:
- “Thank you for protecting me.”
- “I see why you did that.”
- “But you don’t have to do it alone anymore.”

This is the work.

It’s a constant, evolving, moment-by-moment learning process.  
And every time I pause and choose curiosity over shame, something inside loosens.  
Something begins to trust.  
Something begins to heal.
