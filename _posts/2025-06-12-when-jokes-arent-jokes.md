Sometimes, the body knows before the mind does.

A joke gets made at your expense—once, it lands. Twice, it stings. The third time, your body stands up. Literally. You leave the table, the moment, the dynamic.

That’s what happened to me recently. What started as playful teasing turned into something else. By the third repetition, it wasn’t about humour anymore—it was about power. A subtle attempt to undermine. The words may have worn a smile, but the energy behind them didn’t.

And here’s what’s wild: it wasn’t loud. It wasn’t cruel. It was just off. And that’s all it needed to be. My body caught it before I did.

### The Deeper Truth

Looking back, I think it was an unconscious move. I don’t believe she meant harm in the way we think of harm—more like a reflexive jab from someone who might be feeling small inside. Maybe on some level, she saw something in me—potential, presence, a calm she hasn’t yet found in herself—and that contrast made her uncomfortable.

There’s a chance she once felt we were on the same page, and now the pages are turning faster for me. That can stir resentment in people, even when they genuinely like you. Even when you like them.

### I Used to Rescue Her

In past sessions, I found myself trying to rescue her from her emotions. And I think I did that because, deep down, I recognized her resistance. The discomfort. The buried parts she wasn’t ready to face—and maybe I used to do that too.

Now I don’t. Now I just observe.

I’ve stopped playing the role of emotional caretaker to people who aren’t doing the same for me. That doesn’t mean I’ve stopped caring. It just means I’ve started respecting my energy.

### Not Everyone Has to Understand You

Sometimes, people won’t listen. Sometimes, they’ll deflect or make jabs. And sometimes, it’s because they’re fighting battles you’ve already begun to walk away from.

You don’t have to stay and prove your worth.  
You don’t have to explain why the joke wasn’t funny.

You just have to notice when something tightens in your chest, when your skin goes hot, when your feet move before your mind even catches up.

That’s your boundary speaking.  
And it doesn’t owe anyone an explanation.
