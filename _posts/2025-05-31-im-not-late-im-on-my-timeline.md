There are days I feel behind.

Behind in my career. Behind in relationships. Behind in healing, growth, success—whatever story the world says I should’ve written by now.

But then I remember: **there is no timeline I’m supposed to be on but my own.**

Some people find clarity early. Some people bloom late. Some take the scenic route. Some rebuild from scratch. No one’s journey makes mine wrong.

Every time I’ve rushed, I’ve abandoned myself. Every time I’ve slowed down, I’ve found something real.

The truth is: I’ve needed this pace. I’ve needed the setbacks. I’ve needed the space to unlearn and begin again.

I’m not late.  
I’m not off track.

I’m right where I need to be—for *me*.

And that’s enough.
