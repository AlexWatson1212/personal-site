This morning I was irritated.

Not just at one thing — but everything. The dog was annoying me, my son was testing my patience, the neighbour’s ridiculous bush was pushing into my space again, and I felt like I was about to snap. But it wasn’t until I had some space to think that I realised what was actually happening.

It wasn’t about the dog, or the bush, or even my son.

It was about **a consistent lack of respect** — in the little things that add up. The overgrown hedge leaning into my driveway. The leaning fence no one has fixed. The way I’ve let certain things in my life fall into disrepair, maybe because I’ve been too tired, too overwhelmed, or just didn’t think I deserved better.

But I do. I do deserve better.

And this year, I’m drawing a line in the sand.

Not just at the boundary with my neighbour — but within myself.  
Because I’ve realised I can’t keep waiting for other people to care about my space, or my peace.  
It starts with me. **I need to care enough to reclaim it.**

So this year will be about:
- Rebuilding what’s been neglected
- Creating a home that reflects the care I want to feel
- Raising the standard — not to impress others, but because *I* matter

I’m not angry at the world anymore. I’m just done being numb to what hurts.  
Done tolerating what drains me.  
Done being okay with the broken fence.

This isn’t just DIY — it’s healing.  
This is me, quietly and steadily, putting my life back together on my terms.

A line in the sand.  
And this time, I won’t let it be crossed.
