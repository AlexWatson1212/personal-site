### This Isn’t Therapy — But It Might Be Something Deeper

I’ve spent years walking through emotional fire — not in theory, but in life.

And through that journey, I’ve come to a quiet truth:  
**You don’t need a qualification to offer presence, honesty, or deep care.**  
You need experience. You need integrity. You need a willingness to stay with what others run from.

That’s what I bring.

### I’m Not a Therapist

I’m not registered.  
I’m not part of a clinical institution.  
And I’m not pretending to be.

What I *am* is someone who has done the inner work, day after day —  
someone who has lived through trauma, shame, rupture, grief — and made meaning from it.

I don’t diagnose. I don’t treat.  
I listen. I reflect. I support.

### Why I Chose This Path

I’ve seen others — like Ben Cole-Edwards or The School of Self Integration —  
carve out their own way of holding space for healing, grounded in *real presence* and *lived experience*.  
Not as rebels. Not as imposters.  
But as people who said: *“I don’t need to wait anymore.”*

That inspired me.  
Because deep down, I’ve always known — *I’m not here to follow someone else’s map.*  
I’m here to walk mine.

### What I Offer

- Honest, spacious 1:1 conversations  
- Emotional insight rooted in personal experience  
- Support for those navigating trauma, shame, grief, identity, and individuation  
- A grounded, no-jargon approach to inner work

What I offer isn’t therapy.  
It’s something slower, maybe even deeper —  
*It’s being met without being managed.*

---

### What I Don’t Offer

- Diagnoses or medical advice  
- Crisis or emergency care  
- “Fixes” or five-step formulas  
- Anything that pressures you to perform healing

### A Final Word

I’m not against qualifications — I may still pursue them.  
But I no longer believe they’re the only valid path.

If you feel something real in these words, maybe that’s enough for now.  
I trust that the right people will find this — not because of credentials, but because it resonates.

**This is not about rebellion.  
It’s about offering the thing I always needed but could never find.**

And if that’s something you need too, I’m here.
