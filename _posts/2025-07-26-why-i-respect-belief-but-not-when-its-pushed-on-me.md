I’ve always believed that people have the right to believe whatever they want—religiously, ethically, or philosophically.

But I also believe there’s a line.

And that line is crossed **when someone pushes their beliefs onto me**, as if they have some moral obligation to change me.

Whether it's Christians, Muslims, or vegans—I’ve had the same reaction when someone tries to “save” me, correct me, or shame me:
> *“I’m letting you live in peace. Why won’t you let me do the same?”*

## The Nietzschean Lens

I’ve been thinking a lot lately about Nietzsche’s line:

> *“God is dead. And we have killed him.”*

It wasn’t a celebration—it was a warning. He saw that:
- Religion had lost its credibility in the West,
- But we hadn't yet found anything strong enough to replace it.

That left a vacuum.

And in that vacuum, many of us are left **to build our own frameworks**—for morality, meaning, community, and purpose.

But stepping away from inherited systems isn’t easy.  
You lose certainty. You lose ritual. You may lose your community.  
And you’re left to face the chaos of existence on your own.

That’s why religion still exists. It meets so many **human needs**.

I respect that.

## Where Respect Ends: Coercion

But the moment someone uses their belief system **to try and change mine**, I recoil.

It’s not that I’m closed-minded.  
It’s that I’ve *thought deeply* about what I believe—and why.  
I’ve chosen to live in a way that makes sense to me.  
And if I’m not harming anyone, I expect the same courtesy I give others.

Pushy religion, like pushy veganism, rubs me the wrong way.  
Not because their values are wrong—but because their **delivery violates my autonomy**.

I’m not a project.  
I’m a person.

## The Vegan Parallel

I respect ethical veganism. I really do.

I understand the logic:
- If we don’t need to harm animals, why do it?
- If we care about dogs, why not care about pigs?
- If you wouldn’t kill it yourself, why eat it?

And here’s the thing:
> I *would* kill an animal for food.  
> I do believe humans are morally distinct from animals.  
> I don’t condone cruelty—but I accept the reality of life and death.

That’s my belief. And I’m entitled to it.

Just as vegans are entitled to theirs.

But once someone **uses shame or pressure to convert me**, they’ve stopped advocating—and started coercing.

That’s where my respect ends.

## When Belief Becomes a Threat

I’m also not naive.

When certain beliefs **start to harm people around me**, especially within my own country or community, I reserve the right to **intellectually challenge them**.

Whether it’s:
- A belief system that promotes violence,
- One that suppresses women,
- Or one that denies free thought…

…there’s a line between respecting diversity—and protecting shared values.

And if someone’s belief threatens safety, rights, or dignity, I believe it *should* be questioned.

## What I Stand By

I’m not against religion.  
I’m not against veganism.  
I’m not against belief.

What I’m against is **the presumption that someone else knows what’s better for me than I do**.

Because if I’m:
- At peace with myself,
- Living in alignment with my values,
- And not harming others,

…then I deserve to be left alone.

Just like anyone else.

## Final Thought

We can all believe different things.  
That’s part of being free.

But **freedom of belief only works when it’s mutual**.

Respect mine, and I’ll respect yours.  
Try to convert me without invitation, and I’ll walk away.

Not out of pride.  
But out of principle.
