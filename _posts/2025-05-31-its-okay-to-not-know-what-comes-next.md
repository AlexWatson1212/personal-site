There’s a part of me that always wants to know.

What’s the plan?  
Where is this going?  
What’s the next right move?

Uncertainty used to feel unbearable—like something to solve, not sit with. But lately, I’m learning to breathe inside the unknown.

Because the truth is: **clarity doesn’t always arrive on demand.**  
Sometimes it grows in the background.  
Sometimes it asks me to *move first*, without a guarantee.

And while it’s uncomfortable, it’s also strangely freeing.

Not knowing gives me room to experiment.  
To explore.  
To get it a little wrong before I get it right.

I don’t have to figure everything out today.

I can trust the process that’s unfolding, even if I don’t see the whole picture yet.

And I can remind myself:  
I’ve navigated uncertainty before.  
I’ll do it again.

One grounded step at a time.
