I've been called lazy before.  
Often by people who didn’t understand me — or themselves.

I’ve always had this quiet rhythm inside me. A natural intelligence about when to act, when to rest, when to reflect. But when I moved more slowly, when I didn’t push or force or rush... it got labeled.

> “Lazy.”  
> “Unmotivated.”  
> “Wasting potential.”

But here’s what I know now:  
**That wasn’t laziness. That was wisdom.**  
That was survival.  
That was me protecting my energy in a world that constantly demanded proof I was enough.

## What If Laziness Isn’t a Flaw — But a Flag?

I don’t believe in laziness anymore.  
Not really. Not as a character trait.

If someone is healthy and connected to themselves — if their needs are being met and they feel safe in the world — they *will* do things that matter to them. Not because they’re forced to, but because **meaning fuels action**.

And if someone isn’t acting?

It doesn’t mean they’re lazy.  
It means we need to look deeper:

- Are they burnt out?  
- Are they grieving?  
- Are they afraid of failing?  
- Have they learned that effort never got them anywhere before?  
- Do they feel ashamed? Disconnected? Alone?

Most of the time, “laziness” is just a word we throw at people whose pain or rhythm we haven’t tried to understand.

## Rest Isn’t a Moral Failure

Sometimes what looks like “doing nothing” is someone finally healing.  
Sometimes not wanting to “get up and be productive” is someone’s nervous system saying:  
> “I’m overwhelmed. I need gentleness first.”

And sometimes, it’s just someone who values **being**, not always doing — and that doesn’t make them broken.

The shame around “laziness” isn’t helping anyone grow.  
But **understanding, space, and care?**  
That can change everything.

## What I Practice Now

I listen to my energy.  
I make space for stillness.  
I try not to confuse my worth with my output.

And the more I do that, the more I *actually* get done — not because I’m pushing myself, but because I’m finally aligned.

I don’t owe anyone a performance of productivity.  
And neither do you.

## If You’ve Been Called Lazy…

If you’ve ever felt ashamed for needing rest,  
for moving at your own pace,  
for not jumping at every demand...

You’re not lazy.  
You’re a human being.  
And you deserve to be met with care — not judgment.

There’s nothing wrong with you.  
And you don’t have to prove anything.

Sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is rest.  
Sometimes, your body knows the way before your mind catches up.

And if that’s true for you today — let it be enough.
