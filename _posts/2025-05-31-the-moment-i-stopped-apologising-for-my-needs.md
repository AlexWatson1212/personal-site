I used to feel guilty for having needs.

For wanting reassurance. For needing time alone. For asking someone to speak more gently. For setting a boundary. For saying, “That doesn’t work for me.”

There was always a part of me that whispered:
> “Don’t be difficult.”  
> “Don’t push them away.”  
> “Don’t need too much.”

But over time, I’ve realised: my needs aren’t unreasonable. They’re not excessive. They’re simply *mine*. And I’m allowed to honour them—even if someone else doesn’t understand them.

The moment I stopped apologising for my needs was the moment I started building healthier relationships—especially with myself.

Because when I meet my needs with respect, I attract people who do the same.

And that changes everything.
