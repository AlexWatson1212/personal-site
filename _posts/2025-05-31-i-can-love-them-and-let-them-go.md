There’s a quiet kind of heartbreak in letting go of someone you still care about.

No big fight. No betrayal. Just the steady realisation that the connection doesn’t support who you’re becoming.

And that’s hard.

Because love doesn’t always disappear when the relationship no longer fits.  
Sometimes it lingers. Softly. Honestly. Without needing to be acted on.

What I’m learning is this:

**I can love someone and still choose myself.**  
I can hold gratitude and still set boundaries.  
I can wish them well and still walk away.

Letting go doesn’t mean the love wasn’t real.  
It means I’m honouring what *is* real now.

And sometimes, the most loving thing I can do for both of us… is release.

Not with bitterness.  
But with tenderness.

Because growth is never loss when it comes with truth.
