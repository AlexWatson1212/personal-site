I used to think the goal was to become unbreakable.  
Now I realise… the goal is to become steady.

Not someone who never shakes — but someone who can hold themselves *through* the shaking.

That’s what the Wise Adult part of me is becoming.  
Not a voice that tells me to get over it — but one that stays beside me while I feel it.

Sometimes that voice sounds like:
> “Of course this hurts. Let’s sit here and breathe.”  
> “You don’t need to fix this right now. Just stay.”  
> “We’ve felt this before. And we survived. And we will again.”  

Building the Wise Adult isn’t flashy. It’s not loud.  
It’s a quiet series of choices:

- To pause instead of react.  
- To comfort instead of criticise.  
- To ask, *“What would be most loving right now?”*

And sometimes, that love looks like limits. Boundaries. Clarity.  
Not because I’m harsh — but because I care.

This is the part of me I want to lead with.  
Not the wounded child. Not the protector.  
But the calm, rooted adult who doesn’t pretend life is easy —  
but who believes I can handle it anyway.

That’s the person I’m becoming.  
One breath, one decision, one moment of grace at a time.
