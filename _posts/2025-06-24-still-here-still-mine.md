description: She’s loud, she’s rough around the edges, and she probably shouldn’t pass her MOT — but I love this car. Because somehow, she still feels like home.

I drive a 1998 Toyota Celica.  
The exhaust is loud, the paintwork’s got some overspray, and most people would probably tell me it’s time to move on.

But I love that car.

Not in a flashy way. Not in a nostalgic way either.  
In a *real* way.

Because she’s still here.  
She’s still mine.  
And she’s still carrying me, even when everything else feels uncertain.

---

I only use her for short trips — quick runs here and there.  
But when I’m behind the wheel, there’s this strange sense of… **freedom**.

Not because she’s perfect.  
But because she’s **unapologetically imperfect**.

There’s no pretending. No mask. No performance.  
Just an old engine, a loud exhaust, and a little bit of joy.

She’ll go in for her MOT next month.  
Maybe she’ll pass, maybe she won’t. But if she does — I’ve decided to fix up the clear coat.  
Not to make her perfect. Just to say *thank you.*

Because this car — as old and loud and slightly rebellious as she is — has stayed.  
And in a life where so many things have fallen away, that matters.

She doesn’t need to be impressive.  
She just needs to be *herself*.

Kind of like me, really.

Let me know if you'd like to add a photo, a quote, or a follow-up piece after the MOT. This post could live beautifully as a soft pause in your soul-year series.
