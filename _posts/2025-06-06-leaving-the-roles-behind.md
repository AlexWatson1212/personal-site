I used to believe love meant being useful.  
That if I could meet everyone’s needs, I might finally be worthy of having my own.

So I became what people needed:

The caretaker.  
The peacekeeper.  
The listener.  
The one who always showed up — even when no one else did.

I shaped myself around the gaps in other people’s lives, thinking that if I could fill them, maybe I’d feel whole.

But love that requires you to abandon yourself isn’t love.  
It’s a survival role.

For a long time, I thought that if I stopped being useful, I’d be forgotten.  
That if I stopped showing up for everyone else, no one would show up for me.

So I gave.  
And gave.  
And gave.

Until there was barely anything left of me.

Leaving the roles behind doesn’t mean becoming selfish.  
It means becoming *whole*.

It means asking the questions we’ve often avoided:

- What do I need?  
- What does real reciprocity feel like?  
- What happens when I stop performing and start existing?

> How do I respond when someone offers care to me?

It means pausing before saying “yes” out of habit.  
Letting the silence stretch.  
Noticing what fills the space when you stop performing.

It might mean walking away from people who only value your usefulness.

And yes — it might get lonely at first.  
Because when you stop playing the role, some people disappear.

But that’s part of the clarity.

> Who do I feel safe being “unhelpful” around?  
> Who only seems to value me when I’m giving something?

Here’s where I am now — and maybe where you are, too:

I’m no longer available for one-sided relationships.  
I’m no longer interested in being the unpaid therapist.  
I’m no longer building bridges that only I walk across.

This isn’t anger.  
It’s clarity.  
This isn’t bitterness.  
It’s healing.

---

This is the beginning of something more honest.  
More human.  
More mutual.

Where you are not a role — but a person.  
Where you are not needed — but *loved*.

> ✏️ **Final Reflection:**  
> What role am I ready to leave behind today — even just a little?
