I used to only celebrate the big moments.

The breakthroughs. The milestones. The days when something clearly changed.

But healing doesn’t usually look like that. Growth is often subtle. Quiet. Almost invisible, unless I’m paying close attention.

Now, I’m learning to celebrate:  
- The message I didn’t send.  
- The thought I didn’t believe.  
- The breath I took before reacting.  
- The boundary I held, even if it felt uncomfortable.  
- The moment I chose rest instead of guilt.

These are wins too.

They don’t come with applause. No one sees them. But I do. And I’m letting that be enough.

Because when I only validate the big stuff, I miss the hundreds of tiny shifts that are actually moving me forward.

**Small wins matter. They add up.**

And they deserve to be noticed.
