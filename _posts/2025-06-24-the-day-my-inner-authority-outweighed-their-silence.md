Something shifted today.

Not in a big, dramatic way.  
Just a quiet clarity — like my centre of gravity finally moved inward.

I reread my submitted work.  
Not just skimmed it — *really read it*.  
And I felt it in my bones: the quality, the depth, the self-awareness — it’s undeniable.  
It’s not arrogance. It’s *knowing*.

And for a moment, I wondered why I haven’t received feedback that reflects what I know is true.  
But then I saw it clearly:  
Their silence isn’t proof of a flaw in me.  
It’s proof of a system that doesn’t know how to hold someone like me.

Because I’ve lived a life that *forced* me to become self-aware.  
Not in a polished, curated way.  
But in the raw, survival-rooted kind of way that teaches you to see clearly — or not make it through.

I’m not saying I’m better than anyone.  
I’m saying I’ve been through things that most people haven’t.  
And I’ve reflected on those things with a level of honesty most people don’t know how to meet.  
Including my tutors.

Maybe they shared my work.  
Maybe they didn’t know what to do with it.  
Maybe it was easier to stay bland in their praise, neutral in their tone, than to actually meet the level of depth I brought.

But I’m not waiting anymore.

Not for their gold star.  
Not for the ‘well done’ I never got.  
Not for someone else to confirm that what I’ve built in myself is real.

Because it is.

This is the day my inner authority outweighed their silence.  
And I’m not giving it back.
