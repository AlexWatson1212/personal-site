title: A Pause That’s Not a Step Back

I thought I had to keep going.

Keep healing. Keep working. Keep proving something — maybe to myself, maybe to the world.  
I thought Level 4 was the next step I had to take. That I couldn’t afford to pause.

But today, I see it differently.

Taking a year out isn’t a step back. It’s a decision made with care.  
Because what matters right now isn’t a qualification.  
It’s how I show up for my son.

These are the years he’ll remember. The ones that shape him.  
And if I’m too stretched, too distracted, too emotionally depleted — then what am I really offering?

I’ve done a lot of inner work. I’ve faced pain I didn’t think I could survive.  
And maybe now… maybe it’s okay to live a little more.  
To stop trying to fix everything.  
To stop treating healing like a project.

Maybe this year isn’t about breakthroughs.  
Maybe it’s about being here.  
Really being here.  
With him. With myself. With what’s real.

I still love the idea of being a therapist.  
But not at the cost of the relationship that matters most to me.

So I’m pausing.  
Not because I’ve failed.  
But because I’m finally listening to what matters now.
