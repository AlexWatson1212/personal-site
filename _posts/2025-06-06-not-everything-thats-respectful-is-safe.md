description: Sometimes, people who’ve hurt you learn how to treat you respectfully — but that doesn’t mean you can let them back in. Respect is not the same as safety.

Today I realised something I’ve never been able to see clearly before:

> Just because someone is being respectful, doesn’t mean they’re safe.  
> And not everything that’s respectful deserves deeper access to my life.

My ex messaged me respectfully — and in that moment, I appreciated it.  
Not because it made everything okay, and definitely not because it erased the past.  
But because, for once, I felt a boundary being honoured.  

That shouldn’t be rare. But for me, it is.

And it put into sharp focus just how incapable my mother has been —  
how little respect she has ever shown me,  
and how much that absence has shaped the way I’ve learned to tolerate pain.

This doesn’t mean I want anything more with my ex.  
We don’t work together.  
We both carry wounds that trigger each other in ways that are too complex, too corrosive, too costly — especially for our son.

Even now, after all the work I’ve done, too much time with her could unravel it.  
Not because I haven’t healed,  
but because I’ve worked too hard to climb out of that dynamic to ever willingly step back in.

---

And so I’m learning this:

> Respect is a minimum.  
> Safety is something deeper.

Respect might look like a kind message.  
But safety is about how I feel after — whether I still feel grounded, calm, whole.  
Whether I’m still *me*.

Today, I held the line.  
I acknowledged the respect without reopening the door.  
And I recognised that I don’t need to turn small moments of decency into invitations for reconnection.

I’ve learned to see things clearly now.  
And I’m not trading that clarity for anything — not even a flicker of familiarity.

Not everything that’s respectful is safe.  
And I choose safety now.

For me.  
For my son.  
For the man I’ve become.
