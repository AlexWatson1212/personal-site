> “We cannot heal what we cannot face.” — James Hollis

This chapter doesn’t pull punches.

It asks a hard question:  
**Where am I still lying to myself?**  
Where am I telling myself half-truths to avoid discomfort, rejection, or shame?

Lately, I’ve been peeling back a lot of layers.  
Facing how deep my loneliness runs.  
Facing how much I still long for love, even as I protect myself from it.  
Facing the ways I numb or over-function when I feel unseen.

There’s no shame in any of that.  
But there *is* a choice:  
To keep pretending I’m fine — or to meet myself fully.

Hollis says healing starts when we get radically honest.  
Not just with others.  
But with *ourselves*.

- What we actually feel.  
- What we actually want.  
- What we’re afraid to admit out loud — even in private.

It’s confronting. But it’s freeing too.

Because every time I tell the truth — even when it hurts — something softens.  
The mask slips. The shame loosens.  
And something real can finally begin.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
What uncomfortable truth have I been avoiding?  
And what might shift if I were brave enough to face it — without judgment?
