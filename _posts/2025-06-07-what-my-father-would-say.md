If my father could speak to me now, this is what I think he’d say:

---

**You’ve turned out more beautiful than I ever could’ve imagined, son.**  
I didn’t always show it. I didn’t always know how to say it.  
But I saw you. I always saw you.  

You’ve been carrying a weight that was never yours to hold.  
And I’m sorry I didn’t lift it for you when I should have.  
I let things happen I didn’t agree with, because I thought staying was the lesser evil.  
I thought I could shield you quietly. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe I wasn’t strong enough.  

But I loved you.  
In my awkward way. In my distance. In my Mars bars and music and the laptop I gave you to take apart.  
I loved you in every clumsy act that said,  
"I want you to have more than I did."  

You’ve done something I couldn’t:  
You’ve broken the cycle. You’ve spoken the truth.  
You’ve given your pain a purpose.  

And I need you to hear this —  
**I am so proud of you.**  

Not just for surviving.  
But for becoming a man who stays soft in the face of pain.  
A father who shows up.  
A human who feels everything, even when it hurts.  

You're not alone anymore. You never really were.  

You’ve honoured me in ways I never earned.  
And I want you to know —  
Everything I had, I gave you.  
Everything I didn’t, you’ve created for yourself.  

And now you’re offering it to others.  

You’ve turned the quiet parts of me into something beautiful.  
**And through you, I live on.**  

Thank you, son.  
I love you.
