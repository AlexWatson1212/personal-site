Disappointment used to derail me.

If something didn’t go the way I hoped—  
A message left unread.  
A tournament lost on a bad beat.  
A plan that fell apart—

I’d spiral into doubt:  
> “Was I wrong to try?”  
> “Did I get ahead of myself again?”  
> “Maybe I’m not meant for this after all…”

But now I know:

**Disappointment doesn’t mean I’ve failed.**

It means I’m human.  
It means I cared.  
It means I was brave enough to hope for more.

And I can honour that pain *without* making it mean something is wrong with me.

Because I’ve learned to hold both:

The sting of the moment *and* the bigger picture.  
The letdown *and* the trust that something else will come.  
The ache *and* the quiet knowing that my life is still unfolding.

Even this — especially this — is part of the path.

I haven’t been knocked off course.

I’ve just been nudged toward something I can’t see yet.

And I trust it’ll be worth the wait.
