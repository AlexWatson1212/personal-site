I’ve always leaned toward atheism.

Not in a militant or superior way—but more from a deep belief that religion, at its core, is **a rationalisation of existential fear**.  
It gives people certainty in an uncertain world.  
It offers meaning, morality, community, answers to death, suffering, and the chaos of life.

And honestly, I respect that.

But lately, I’ve been watching a lot of content online—specifically around *Muscular Christianity*.  
One figure, Bob, stands out. He debates Muslims in public spaces, dissects the Qur’an, points out logical fallacies, and essentially argues that Christianity is intellectually superior.

At first, I respected his clarity. His confidence. His composure.  
He looks sharp, sounds intelligent, and clearly knows how to take apart weak arguments.  
But over time, something began to feel... off.

## Is It About Truth? Or About Power?

Bob often debates people who aren’t particularly well-versed in their own faith.  
He wins, but the win feels hollow—like he’s less interested in real dialogue and more interested in **performing dominance**.

And that’s where I start to feel uncomfortable.

Because if religion is a personal belief system, is it ever okay to **push your faith onto others**, even if you're convinced you're right?

At the same time, if someone's belief is rooted in **violence, oppression, or misinformation**—don’t we have a responsibility to challenge it?

That’s the tension I’m sitting with:
> *“Where’s the line between respecting belief and questioning it?”*

## When Belief Becomes Dangerous

It’s easy to say *“everyone has a right to believe what they want.”*  
And I do believe that.

But what happens when those beliefs:
- Justify the suppression of women,
- Endorse violence toward non-believers,
- Frame dissent as evil,
- Or encourage psychological or physical harm?

Is silence then a form of complicity?

Is it wrong to question beliefs if doing so might challenge a person’s entire worldview—or *are we obligated to speak up when those beliefs perpetuate harm?*

These aren’t easy questions.

## Why I Still Struggle With Religion

For me, **no religion fully survives under the weight of intellectual scrutiny**.  
Not because all believers are unintelligent—but because faith often lives **outside of reason**.

It’s myth.  
It’s metaphor.  
It’s symbolic language for things that logic alone can’t hold.

I’ve always seen that as a weakness.

But lately, I’m wondering if that’s where its *power* lies too.

---

## Could I Be Wrong?

That’s the difference between Bob and me.

He debates with certainty.  
I live with doubt.

But maybe that doubt is its own kind of reverence.  
Maybe it's not about *proving* a religion wrong—but about asking:
- What are you really seeking?
- What does this belief offer you that life hasn’t?
- What happens when belief is used as a shield against pain—or a weapon against others?

## What I Believe Now

I still don’t believe in a personal god.

I still see religion, for many, as a container for existential terror.

But I also believe:
- You can question beliefs **without attacking people**.
- You can hold your values **without needing others to validate them**.
- You can speak up **when beliefs cause harm**, and still respect someone’s right to believe.

Because the truth is:
> **I don’t care what someone believes—until their belief starts hurting others.**

And when it does, *yes*, it’s fair to challenge it.  
Not to win.  
Not to feel superior.  
But because integrity matters.

---

## Final Thought

Maybe religion isn’t meant to survive intellectual honesty.

Maybe it’s meant to **transform under it**.

And maybe the real goal isn’t to dismantle belief systems—but to **strip away what’s harmful, and leave behind what still helps people live with kindness, courage, and grace.**

I don’t have answers.  
But I’m okay with that.

Because sometimes, *not knowing* is the most honest thing we can do.
