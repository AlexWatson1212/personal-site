description: A quiet reflection on how depleted I’ve been, what led to it, and how it feels to finally recharge — not just physically, but emotionally.

Looking at the last month on my Garmin, one thing stands out:  
I’ve barely been able to **recover**.

There were maybe a few spikes of energy, but nothing sustained.  
My body battery would rise and then crash — fast.  
And I felt it.  

Getting rejected from Level 4 hit me harder than I realised.  
Not just emotionally, but energetically.  
It’s like it drained my *capacity* — my ability to regulate, rest, and show up the way I want to, especially as a dad.

I notice how that period bled into the way I looked after Victor.  
Not that I wasn’t there — but I wasn’t *fully there*.  
There wasn’t enough of me to go around.

And that hurt.  

Because I *want* to be the kind of dad who has reserves.  
Who can stay patient.  
Who can offer presence instead of just surviving the day.

This weekend, though, I felt something shift.  
I hit 100% body battery for the first time in a long while.  
And what’s more — I stayed regulated.  
I played football with Vic.  
I handled awkward social moments.  
I set boundaries.  
I was present.  
I *parented* — not perfectly, but from a fuller place.  

And I think I did a good job.  
A really good job.

This isn’t just about energy levels.  
It’s about **self-respect**.  
It’s about seeing what happens when I finally have space to **be myself again**, and how that self shows up in love.  

I don’t want to be that depleted again.  
I don’t want to run on fumes and then judge myself for not giving enough.  
I want to keep doing the quiet work that allows me to be the man I actually am underneath the burnout.

Because I *am* a good father.  
And a good man.  
And I show up better when I’m not at war with myself.
