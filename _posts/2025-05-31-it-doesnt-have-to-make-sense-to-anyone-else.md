Sometimes I catch myself explaining too much.

Why I’m resting instead of pushing.  
Why I’m not reaching out to certain people anymore.  
Why I’m saying no to things that used to drain me.

Like I need to justify it. Like I need people to *understand* my healing before I can trust it myself.

But lately, I’m realising:  
> It doesn’t have to make sense to anyone else.

Not everyone will get the choices I’m making. Not everyone needs to. The people who truly respect me won’t demand a full emotional audit every time I change direction.

I don’t owe a PowerPoint on why I’ve evolved.

My boundaries, my pace, my way of living—it’s allowed to look strange to others. It’s allowed to be unconventional. It’s allowed to be *mine*.

Because I’m not here to be understood by everyone.

I’m here to be at peace with myself.
