> “The greatest burden the child must bear is the unlived life of the parent.”
— James Hollis



This line stopped me.

Because I’ve carried it.
And now, as a father, I feel the weight of not wanting to pass it on.

When a parent hasn’t fully lived — hasn’t processed their own grief, rage, dreams, or regrets — it doesn’t just disappear. It seeps into the home. It becomes the air the child breathes.

I didn’t just grow up with rules or routines.
I grew up with my parents’ emotional leftovers.
What they suppressed.
What they never dared to face.
What they expected me to carry, without ever asking.

And I did carry it. For a long time.
Trying to be the “good” child.
Trying not to take up too much space.
Trying to succeed, behave, fix, smooth over.
Until I couldn’t anymore.

Now I see it for what it was:
It wasn’t mine.

Their shame?
Their avoidance?
Their silence?
Not mine to fix. Not mine to hold. Not mine to continue.

But here’s the thing — I’m a parent now, too.
And I know I won’t be perfect.
I know I’ll pass on some things unconsciously.
But I also know this: I will not hand my son the weight of my unlived life.

I’m doing the work now.
So he doesn’t have to carry what I didn’t have the courage to face.
So he can walk into his life without dragging mine behind him.

And if that means I have to revisit old wounds? So be it.
If it means I have to break cycles I didn’t start? So be it.
Because my son deserves a chance to carry only what’s his.

That’s the sacred work of parenting.
Not perfection.
But taking back what was never meant to be passed on.
