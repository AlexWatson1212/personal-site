description: Sometimes the kindest thing we can do — for ourselves and for others — is to walk on, gently but firmly, when we realise the conversation was never meant to include us.

I used to give people space they hadn’t earned.

Let them talk.  
Let them avoid eye contact with the dog, or worse — use the dog to open up space they never really intended to share.

I’d stand there in silence, listening to stories I didn’t ask for, because I thought that was kindness.  
Because I felt the loneliness behind it.

But now, I see it clearly:  
If someone can’t ask even *one* question about me, that silence is saying something.  
And I’m allowed to listen to *that*.

---

I don’t owe anyone space just because they’re lonely.  
I’ve been lonely too.  
But I didn’t speak *at* people — I tried to meet them.

There’s a difference.

---

So now, when someone avoids the dog — or uses the walk as a monologue — I don’t overstay.

I nod.  
Say, “You’re right.”  
And keep walking.

Because I’m not here to be the audience for someone else’s avoidance.  
And every time I give my energy to a one-sided connection, I lose the capacity to hold space for those who genuinely want to connect — including myself.

---

This isn’t about being harsh.  
It’s about being *clear*.

Clear that my energy matters.  
That connection is a two-way street.  
And that I’m done letting people treat me like a mirror with no reflection.

---

I wish them well.  
I really do.

But I walk on now.
