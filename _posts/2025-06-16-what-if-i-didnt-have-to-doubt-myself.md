I keep wondering if there’s something wrong with me for doing this.

Building this site. Writing these things. Sharing so much of myself.  
Am I just doing this for attention? Is this ego? Am I secretly trying to prove something?

My mind searches for some kind of *malicious reasoning*.  
Like if I dig deep enough, I’ll find a selfish core — a rotten root.

But here’s the truth that landed softly today:  
**I don’t think I’ll find it within myself.**

Because I’m not doing this to manipulate.  
I’m not doing this to impress.  
I’m not even doing it to be seen in a particular way.

I think I’m just… trying to find myself.  
And maybe, in doing that, I’ll find connection.  
And maybe, that’s okay.

Maybe the desire to be known isn’t shameful.  
Maybe sharing something vulnerable doesn’t mean I’m self-obsessed.  
Maybe wanting others to heal too doesn’t mean I think I’ve got all the answers.

Maybe it’s all *intertwined* —  
Trying to know myself.  
Trying to reach others.  
Trying to live honestly.

And maybe I don’t have to untangle it to validate it.

Because at the end of the day, I’m not trying to be a hero or a guru.  
I’m just someone who’s tired of performing,  
tired of pretending,  
and tired of doubting myself.

So what if…  
**What if I didn’t have to doubt myself anymore?**

What if I let this be enough?  
What if goodness didn’t need to be proven?  
What if this is already worthy, just as it is?

That’s the quiet revolution.  
And I’m stepping into it, one breath at a time.
