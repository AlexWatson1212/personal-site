description: I used to unconsciously search for a nurturing parent in others — and often found the critical one instead. Now I see the pattern clearly, and I’m learning to meet myself with the compassion I was never given.

I’ve started to see a pattern that has run through most of my relationships.

At some level, I think I’ve been searching for a part of myself in other people — the part that was never fully met in childhood. The nurturing parent. The one who sees me gently, holds space, offers warmth without judgment.

But instead of that, I often ended up with the critical parent — the voice that judges, corrects, stands one step above.  
And I took the one-down position.  
Again and again.

It’s not always obvious.  
Sometimes the relationship even feels healthy on the surface.  
But when I look closely, the dynamic is still there — that sense that I’m the one being helped, tolerated, subtly managed.

And the truth is...  
On some level, I wanted that.

Not the criticism, but the care. The containment. The feeling that someone could finally give me what I missed.

Of course I looked for it in others.  
Of course I kept ending up in uneven dynamics.  
Because I’d never known what it felt like to be held without hierarchy.

For a long time, I denied how bad my childhood really was.  
How little attunement there was.  
How unskilled my parents were at parenting.

And because I couldn’t face that, I internalised all the shame of it.  
I believed it was me. That I was too much. Too sensitive. Too needy.

But it wasn’t me.  
The shame didn’t start in me. It was passed to me — by parents who couldn’t meet my needs, and then made me feel wrong for having them.

And I’ve been carrying that shame into relationships ever since.

---

But now I see it.

I’m not broken for wanting to be nurtured.  
I’m not weak for needing softness.  
I’m just someone who never received it — and now knows how to name that wound.

And that changes everything.

Because if I can be conscious of the pattern, I don’t have to keep repeating it.  
And if I can meet myself with compassion, I won’t need others to hold what I’m not willing to hold within.

I don’t need saving.  
I don’t need fixing.  
I just need truth. And care. And the kind of love that starts from within.

And that… I can give myself now.
