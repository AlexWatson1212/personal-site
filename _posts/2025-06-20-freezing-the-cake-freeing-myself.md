description: A reflection on how something as simple as freezing slices of lemon cake has become a powerful act of self-parenting—and a symbol of the healing integration I’ve been working toward for years.

There’s been a pattern in me for a long time.  
One I’ve danced with for years.  
A quiet, persistent dynamic between my inner child and inner parent. And it shows up most clearly in something seemingly small:

**Lemon cake.**

Most nights lately, I’ve been going back to the kitchen for another slice.  
Not out of hunger. But out of uncertainty. Loneliness. A need for comfort I haven’t always known how to give myself.

And this week, I realised something simple that felt incredibly important:

> I can freeze the cake.

Not to restrict it. Not to control myself.  
But to give that child inside me what he’s longing for **with care** instead of chaos.

---

When the inner child is scared, tired, or uncertain, he reaches for what he knows: sugar, sweetness, comfort.  
And when the inner parent is **absent**, that reaching becomes unconscious, automatic, sometimes overwhelming.

But when the inner parent is present—not angry, not shaming, just *present*—everything softens.

So now, I’m freezing the cake in slices.

Each piece becomes a small act of self-love.  
A symbol of care, of trust, of boundary without punishment.

---

Because when I ignore that deeper voice—the one I now think of as my soul—I feel it.  
My energy slumps.  
Coping mechanisms become louder.  
I spiral into analysis, shame, or overthinking.

But when I listen to my body… when I pause before eating… when I check in with the part of me that feels lost or uncertain, and ask:

> *“What do you really need right now?”*

I find that the cake isn’t the only answer.  
And sometimes it’s not the answer at all.

---

I’ve started to realise that this integration—the relationship between the part of me that longs for sweetness and the part of me that can offer structure—might be **the most healing work of all**.

Because it’s the one that has kept me stuck in a body I don’t quite feel at home in.  
And I want to feel lighter. Not just in weight—but in *how I live inside myself.*

This is not a diet.  
This is not discipline.  
This is **reparenting**.  
This is finally saying to my inner child:

> *“You’re allowed to want. You’re allowed to need.  
And I will help you meet those needs—not blindly, but with love.”*

---

So I freeze the cake.  
Not to deprive myself—but to remind myself:

> I don’t need to eat everything all at once to feel okay.  
I just need to know that I’m not alone in the craving anymore.

And if I can learn to pause… listen… and offer comfort in other ways—  
A walk, a breath, a quiet sit with my fear—

Then I begin to build a relationship where I can trust myself again.

This is the shift.  
This is the healing.  
One slice at a time.
