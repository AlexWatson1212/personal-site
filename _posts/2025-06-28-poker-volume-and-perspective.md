I took this photo today — a snapshot of my recent results. It was more than just a graph. It was a reminder of something deeper:

That with enough volume, even the hardest moments soften.

That last jagged edge — the mini downswing — felt *huge* in real time. It had me questioning things, wondering if I’d lost my edge or if I was pushing too hard. And yet… when I zoom out, when I *actually* look at the big picture — I see growth. I see that I’ve made money. That I’ve made it through.

It’s been a couple of weeks since the 10k win. And since then, I’ve had a bit of a dry stretch. But today, I made a final table. I made profit. I stuck to my structure. I didn’t over-register. I played well. I trusted the process.

And the graph — well, it’s not just numbers. It’s a reflection of patience. Of thousands of decisions, some painful, some brilliant, all part of a bigger movement toward stability.

### What This Teaches Me

- **Volume matters.** It stretches out the variance and gives context.
- **Perspective matters more.** Because without it, even a small downswing feels like failure.
- **Emotional regulation is edge.** The difference between spiraling and showing up is often internal.

This lifestyle isn’t always easy. But this graph today — it gave me a little peace. It reminded me that I *am* good at this. That I *can* make a living. That one frustrating week doesn’t define me.

Zoom out. Breathe. Keep playing your game.
