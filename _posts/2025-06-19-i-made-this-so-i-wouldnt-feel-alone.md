I think part of me made this website so I wouldn’t feel so alone.

I don’t say that as a weakness. I say it as truth.

I lost the path I thought I was on. I didn’t get onto the counselling course. The future I imagined—the identity, the direction, the community—it disappeared. And what was left was just me. Sitting in the space where something *used to be.*

And maybe that’s when I started building this site—not as a strategy or a plan, but as a response to something deeper. Loneliness. Disorientation. Grief. Maybe even fear.

There’s shame in admitting that. I feel like I *shouldn’t* be in this position. That I *should* have more friends, more certainty, more connection by now. I’ve done the work. I’ve opened up. I’ve healed. Haven’t I?

And yet here I am.

But maybe this is what healing looks like, too.  
Maybe reaching for something—*anything*—when you feel lost isn’t weakness.  
Maybe it’s instinct. Maybe it’s courage.

I didn’t build this because I had it all figured out.  
I built it because I didn’t.  
And because I still needed a way to keep showing up.

So here I am. Still writing. Still trying to be honest.  
Still finding a way through.
