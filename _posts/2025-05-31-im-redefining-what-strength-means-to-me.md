Growing up, I thought strength meant holding everything in.

Don’t cry.  
Don’t break.  
Don’t ask for help.

Just keep going.

But I see now—  
That wasn’t strength.  
That was survival.

And I’m not surviving anymore.  
I’m living.

**And that means redefining what strength looks like for me.**

Sometimes, strength means pausing.  
Sometimes, it means saying, *“I need support.”*  
Sometimes, it means laying down the armour and letting someone see what’s real.

Not to be saved—  
But to be witnessed.

That takes courage.

It’s not weak to feel deeply.  
It’s not weak to care.  
It’s not weak to rest when I’m tired.

That’s wisdom.

And that’s the kind of strength I choose now—  
Honest. Human. Whole.
