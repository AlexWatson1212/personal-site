There’s a question that’s been circling in my mind:

**Is there space for someone like me in the existing therapy world?**

I don’t mean space to *force* myself into the system. I mean space to be who I truly am — soulful, intuitive, trauma-aware, open-hearted — *without having to shrink or mask myself to be accepted*.

The truth is, I’ve started to feel like the answer might be no.

### What the BACP Represents

The BACP — the main regulatory body for counsellors in the UK — exists to ensure standards, ethics, and client safety. And that matters. But over time, it has also become a system that:
- **Favors conformity over depth.**
- **Prioritizes textbook knowledge over lived experience.**
- **Frames professionalism in ways that often exclude trauma survivors, neurodivergent individuals, and soul-led practitioners.**

I get the intention. But in practice, it leaves many of us — those who have healed outside the lines — feeling like we don't belong.

### The Overlooked Value of Lived Experience

I’ve walked through fire. I’ve known grief, psychosis, abandonment, burnout, and breakdown — and I’ve slowly, painfully, learned how to turn toward it all instead of away.

And yet, when I stand beside someone who memorized theory but hasn’t met their own shadow, *they’re the one deemed “safe” by the system*.

It raises the question: **What does true safety actually look like?**

To me, it looks like congruence. Humility. Inner work. Capacity to sit with pain without needing to fix it. It looks like *embodied presence*, not polished performance.

### A Glimpse of What’s Possible

I once worked on a peer support worker scheme — not as a counsellor, but as someone offering care and presence from a place of lived experience. And in many ways, it felt like a glimpse into the very thing I now long for.

It was human. Grounded. Real.

But I was also parenting alone, studying counselling, and doing too much. One day a week became one day too many, and I had to let it go.

Still, the experience stayed with me — because it showed me that healing work **doesn’t have to look like therapy as we know it**. Sometimes, the most healing thing is simply sitting beside someone who’s been through it too.

### A Gap in the Culture

There’s a real gap opening up — not just in the therapy world, but in the culture at large.

People are seeking:
- **Relational healing**, not rigid protocols.
- **Authenticity over neutrality**.
- **Guides who have *been there***, not just studied the map.

But the systems built to train and validate therapists haven’t caught up. They’re still holding the line around what therapy *used to be*, rather than imagining what it *could become*.

So here we are — with more and more people awakening to their pain, reaching out for support, and discovering that the people most equipped to meet them… aren't recognized by the institutions in charge.

### What If We Built Something New?

What if we created a new kind of collective?  
A new kind of standard?  
A new kind of therapist?

One rooted in:
- Ethical care without rigidity,
- Supervision and community without hierarchy,
- Embodiment, relationality, and soul.

It wouldn’t mean rejecting everything that came before — but **evolving it**.

Maybe the old system was the scaffolding. But now the house is being built differently.

And maybe it’s okay if I don’t fit the mold.  
Because maybe the mold is what’s cracking —  
so something more human can grow.
