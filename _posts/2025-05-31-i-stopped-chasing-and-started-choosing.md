I used to chase connection.

Chase approval. Chase love. Chase people who gave just enough to keep me hopeful but never enough to feel secure.

I thought effort would make them stay. That if I just *showed up harder*, they’d finally meet me where I was.

But all that chasing did was pull me further from myself.

So I stopped.

**I stopped chasing—and started choosing.**

Choosing peace over potential.  
Choosing consistency over crumbs.  
Choosing myself when someone else wouldn’t.

Now, I don’t wait to be picked.  
I notice who shows up.  
Who reciprocates.  
Who makes me feel safe, not small.

And I choose from there.

Because love isn’t something I earn by abandoning myself.

It’s something I share with someone who knows what to do with it.

That starts with me.
