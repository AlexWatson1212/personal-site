I’m a little full. I had too many cupcakes. My thighs are itchy — maybe a rash. I don’t know why.  
My body battery is down to 12%. I laid down for a while in silence, hoping I’d drift off, but nothing happened. I think I just really need rest.

I reckon I’ll sleep a bit tonight.  
And even if I don’t, I’ll still show up for Victor tomorrow — and that’s what matters.  
Wednesday and Thursday I get to myself. Friday through Monday morning, I’m back with him.  
And then — 10 days to recover. 10 days to recalibrate.  

It’s a new system we’re trying. And honestly… I’m excited to see how it works.

Our co-parenting setup is really healthy now. The structure gives us what we need, but there’s space for spontaneity — adventures, trips, new memories. If he wants me at both football matches, I’ll be there. His mum wouldn’t mind.

It’s taken a while, but I’m excited about my life. I’ve always had that spark — but recently I needed space to reflect.  
To grieve.

A family that never quite held me.  
A mother who couldn’t love me.  
A father too weak to show his love.  
A sister pulled away by manipulation.  
A partner who couldn’t grow with me.  
Friends who didn’t care like I needed.

There’s so much to grieve.  
But I’m not stuck there.  

I’m grieving the old me too — the one who accepted breadcrumbs, thinking it was a feast.  
Because he didn’t know there was even a slice of bread elsewhere.  
Maybe I’ve had that slice now.  
Maybe not the whole loaf — maybe that’s unattainable.  
But it’s worth moving toward.

And tonight, that’s enough.
