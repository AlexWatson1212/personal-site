I say to myself that I’m open.  
But… am I?

Am I truly open to connection?  
Am I *welcoming* people in — or am I quietly turning away when love starts to approach?

There’s a subtle kind of avoidance I’ve started to notice in myself.  
A subconscious flinch. A retreat into the familiar shelter of solitude, even while outwardly saying I want closeness.

So I asked myself honestly:  
> *Do I really want connection? Or am I terrified of it?*

And the answer is: **both.**

### The Price of Not Sitting With It

Here’s what I’ve realized:

If I don’t let myself feel the depth of this loneliness —  
If I keep numbing, distracting, softening it just enough to tolerate —  
Then I’ll never be desperate or courageous enough to seek what I truly need.

I’ll stay just comfortable enough in isolation.  
Safe, but disconnected.  
Alive, but not living.

### A Quiet Kind of Gratitude

That’s why I’m starting to feel something surprising:  
**Gratitude for my loneliness.**

Because it’s *not here to break me*. It’s here to move me.  
To remind me that I *was never meant to stay comfortable in isolation.*

Loneliness is not a flaw — it’s a flare.  
A message from my deeper self, saying:  
> *“You were made for something more.”*

And the only way I’ll ever experience the kind of connection I long for — real, mutual, safe — is if I walk toward it. Sword in hand. Nervous system screaming. But still walking.

### Not Just Willing — *Wanting*

I don’t want to just “be okay” on my own anymore.  
I *can* be — I’ve proven that.  
But I want more than okay.

I want to connect.  
To let people see me.  
To offer my love. To receive it.

And if I have to feel every ounce of emptiness first to get there — then so be it.  
I’ll feel it. I’ll sit with it. And then I’ll walk toward the light.
