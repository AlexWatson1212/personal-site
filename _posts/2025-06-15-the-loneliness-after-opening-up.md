Sometimes, I think it couldn’t be worse — emotionally speaking.  
No friends. No partner. No real, sustained love across my life.

I used to pretend that wasn’t true.  
Now I see it. And it’s crushing.

Because I’ve started to let myself feel. I’ve opened up in therapy. I’ve started to show myself in group counselling. And oddly — painfully — that’s when the grief came.

Not because those spaces are unsafe… but because they *are*.  
And for the first time, my body is beginning to realise just how much I never had.

I’ve never truly been loved.

Not by my mother.  
Not in friendship.  
Not in partnership.  
Just tiny glimmers, here and there — mostly from people trained to offer it. Therapists. Counsellors. People who hold space professionally.

And now that I know what it feels like to be met, even a little…  
I see the *void* that came before. The gap where love should have been.  
And I’m exhausted. Not just tired — *deeply drained.* As if my whole nervous system is catching up to the truth it’s spent a lifetime avoiding.

And yeah — I’m eating half a lemon drizzle cake.  
Not because I’m hungry, but because I need something to hold me.  
Something soft. Something sweet. Something that doesn’t abandon me.

I don’t think people realise what it does to a person — to go unloved for decades, and then be judged for how that pain shows up.  
I was desperate for connection. And instead of care, I was often mocked. Dismissed. Seen as less. Like my loneliness made me defective.

But it didn’t. It made me *human.*

I acted out not because I was flawed — but because I was *starved.*  
Starved of love. Starved of reflection. Starved of safety.

And now that I’m finally learning what those things feel like…  
Now that I feel a sense of love in my training group…  
I realise how much I’ve missed.

And it breaks me.

Not in a way that destroys me.  
But in a way that *reveals me.*  
In a way that says, *“Yes, this is grief. But you’re finally feeling it now. That’s how it heals.”*

So I’ll sit here. Full of lemon cake. Full of sadness.  
Not because I’m failing.  
But because I’m finally beginning to *grieve the life I never got* —  
And maybe, slowly, open the door to one I can still create.
