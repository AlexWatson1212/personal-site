I used to mistake intensity for connection.

If it was complicated, I thought it meant depth.  
If I had to work for it, I thought it was more real.  
If I felt anxious around them, I called it passion.

But time—and healing—have shown me something different.

**The right people feel easy to be around.**

They don’t leave me second-guessing myself.  
They don’t require me to be “on.”  
They don’t make me shrink to fit into their world.

With the right people, I breathe deeper.  
I laugh more easily.  
I say what I mean without rehearsing it in my head first.

It’s not that there’s never conflict or growth—there is.

But the foundation is *safety*, not survival.

Now, I listen to how my body feels around someone.

Tense? On edge? Exhausted?  
That’s information.

Calm? Open? Energised?  
That’s home.

And that’s what I’m building my life around now.
