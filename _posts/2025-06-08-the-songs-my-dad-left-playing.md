My dad wasn’t the kind of man who talked about his emotions.  
But during my teenage years, there was a kind of silence he *filled with music*.

He didn’t sing them.  
But he played them—**incessantly**.

Adele’s *Someone Like You*.  
Coldplay’s *Clocks*.  
Evanescence’s *Bring Me to Life*.

And the more I reflect on it, the more I wonder:  
**Was that his way of speaking? Of grieving? Of remembering something he never fully named?**

### 💔 Adele – *Someone Like You*  
*A song of grief disguised as strength.*

> *"Nevermind, I’ll find someone like you..."*

It would play quietly in the background—on drives, in the kitchen, through thin walls at night.  
A love song, yes—but also a lament. A goodbye that never settled. A wound still slightly open.

I think he felt this.  
Not just for someone else—but for the man he might’ve been.

### ⏳ Coldplay – *Clocks*  
*A song of time slipping away.*

> *"Am I part of the cure, or am I part of the disease?"*

The piano never stopped. That circular riff—it felt like time looping. Like regret on repeat.

He didn’t say much, but I could feel the friction in him.  
Like he was living life from a distance.  
This song sounded like what it felt like to be around him. Present, but unreachable.

### 🕯 Evanescence – *Bring Me to Life*  
*A song of emotional shutdown and the longing to be revived.*

> *"Wake me up inside… Save me from the nothing I’ve become."*

This one scared me a little.  
Not because of the music—but because it felt *too real*.

Who was he playing this for? Himself? My mum? God? No one?

Maybe a part of him was numb. And this song was trying to cut through the ice.

### 🧠 What These Songs Share

It’s not genre.  
It’s *emotional paralysis*.  
It’s longing. Regret. Sleepwalking. A quiet plea for something real.

These songs are about:
- Wanting to be woken up  
- Mourning a life that passed unspoken  
- Feeling stuck in your own mind  
- Wishing someone could pull you out

He never said those things out loud.  
But maybe, through these songs, he *did*.

### ✍️ What That Left In Me

I grew up with the ache of those songs all around me.  
Not loud. But always present. Like emotional wallpaper.

And maybe that’s why I feel things so deeply.  
Why I don’t want to numb.  
Why I write.

Because even if he never found a way to say it—  
I will.

> I will not be unreachable.  
> I will not drown in silence.  
> I will wake myself up.

And maybe, just maybe,  
**I’ll be the one who names what the music tried to say.**
