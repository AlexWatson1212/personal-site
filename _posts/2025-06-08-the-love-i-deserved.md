This isn’t about blame.  
This isn’t even about them.

It’s about naming the love I needed — and never received.  
Because if I don’t name it, I’ll keep searching for it in places that can’t offer it.  
And I’ll keep doubting that I was ever worthy of it to begin with.

So here it is.

### 💬 The Love I Deserved

I deserved a father who softened when I cried.  
I deserved a mother who saw me and smiled.  
I deserved to feel wanted — not used.  
Held — not handled.  
Guided — not pushed out.

I deserved a home that didn’t feel like a test I was always failing.  
I deserved conversations, not silence.  
Warmth, not coldness disguised as strength.

I deserved to be asked what I felt — and to be listened to.  
I deserved to be celebrated for who I was, not what I did.  
I deserved safety without having to earn it.

I deserved a parent who said:  
> *“I love you. I’m proud of you. I’ve got you.”*

And meant it.

### 🩹 Why I’m Naming This Now

Because for too long, I tried to make their version of love enough.  
Tried to explain it. Understand it. Excuse it.

But the truth is — it wasn’t enough.  
And no amount of inner work will make it retroactively nurturing.

Naming the love I deserved doesn’t mean I’m stuck.  
It means I’m finally facing forward.

### 🕯 And for My Inner Child

You were never too much.  
You were never unworthy.  
You didn’t ask for anything unreasonable.  
You asked for love — and got confusion.  
You asked for care — and got distance.

But I see you now.  
And I will not let you go unseen ever again.

This is the love I deserved.  
And this is the love I’m learning to give — to myself, to my child, to the future.

One clear truth at a time.
