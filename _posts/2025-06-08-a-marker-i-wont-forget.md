There’s something about embracing authenticity now that feels different.  
It’s not a performance. Not even a goal.  
It’s a marker. A vow. A way of remembering every version of me that fought to be seen — and every time I betrayed myself trying to be accepted.

Embracing authenticity doesn’t mean I have all the answers.  
It just means I refuse to abandon myself again.

It’s a safety net.  
A quiet promise.  
A thread that weaves every fragmented part of me into something whole.

Even when I forget, it remembers.  
Even when I slip, it softens the fall.  
Even when I question myself, it holds me accountable — not with shame, but with grace.

This is my compass now.  
This is how I remember who I am.  
This is how I keep going, with all of me intact.
