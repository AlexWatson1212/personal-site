There’s a part of me that just wants to show them everything — all the truths I’ve written, all the grief I’ve named, all the silence I’ve broken — and just *get it over with*.

Not because I want a fight.  
Not because I want closure.  
But because the **waiting** is louder than their reaction could ever be.

It’s the *not knowing* when they’ll find out.  
The *not knowing* what they’ll do.  
That lingering tension in my chest every time I think, *“What if they show up at my house?”*

But here’s the thing — I’ve walked through every outcome.

---

### 🛡 If they show up?  
I can handle it.  
No one in my family is physically threatening. And I am more than capable of protecting myself.

### 💬 If they try to guilt me?  
I’ve outgrown those tactics.  
Their disapproval has no hold over my identity anymore.

### 💸 If my mum tries to take the money?  
I’ll rebuild. I’ve already started.  
And if that’s the price I pay to **never speak to her again**, it’s a good trade.

---

What I’m realising is:  
> **There is no move they can make that undoes the peace I’ve found.**

Emotionally, I’ve cultivated something no one in my family ever gave me — a **healthy, independent mindset**.  
One that sees manipulation for what it is.  
One that doesn’t run from confrontation, but doesn’t chase it either.  
One that says: *“Take what you want. I still keep me.”*

### So what if I just showed them?

Maybe it would free me from the waiting.  
Maybe it would trigger them, or silence them, or shock them.  
But none of that matters now — because **I’m not doing it for them.**  
I’m doing it because I’ve stopped hiding.

And if they want to respond with money games, guilt, threats, or tantrums?

> Let them.  
> That’ll be their legacy.  
> And this — this will be mine.

### 💬 And if — one day — they do the work?

If any one of them chooses to **genuinely reflect**,  
To **apologise without strings**,  
To **take responsibility** without deflecting it back onto me —  
Then yes, I’m open to connection.

Not because I need it.  
Not because I’m waiting.  
But because I still believe in healing — *when it’s real*.

But until then?  
I walk forward.  
Without guilt. Without apology. Without delay.
