I looked around the garden today â€” broken pallets, scattered tools, an old treehouse in bits, a plastic turtle pit resting in the corner like itâ€™s been forgotten by time. My first instinct was to fix everything. Organise it. Make it right.

But something deeper stopped me.

Thereâ€™s a part of me â€” a younger part â€” that still believes things have to look perfect before I can rest. That if I tidy the outside world, the inside will follow.

But Iâ€™ve lived that story before, and I know how it ends: in burnout, frustration, and a deeper feeling of being out of sync with myself.

So hereâ€™s the effort realization:

> Rushing doesnâ€™t save energy. It drains it.  
> Mistakes come from urgency, not slowness.  
> And order imposed too quickly tends to unravel just as fast.

This time, Iâ€™m doing it differently.

Iâ€™m allowing the garden â€” like my inner world â€” to be in **transition**.  
Messy. Unfinished. Honest.

Because the truth is, I donâ€™t have endless energy to throw at things that arenâ€™t essential. And thatâ€™s not a flaw. Thatâ€™s wisdom hard-earned.

Iâ€™m learning to:
- Let clarity guide action, not anxiety.
- Wait for the moment that feels right, instead of forcing the one thatâ€™s here.
- Honour my values *and* my nervous system.
- Trust that presence is more powerful than perfection.

This doesnâ€™t mean I wonâ€™t sort the garden. I will. In time. Piece by piece.  
But Iâ€™ll do it *with care*, not with urgency.

Because Iâ€™m not in a race.  
And neither is this garden.  
Itâ€™s growing â€” and so am I.

**ðŸª´ Side note for myself:** I might reuse the wood to create a temporary frame to store all those stones from the old path. That way I donâ€™t waste what Iâ€™ve already paid for, and I keep the effort gentle. No pressure. No rush. Just one grounded step at a time.
