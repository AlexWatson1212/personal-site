**By Myself**

I’ve been noticing something in Victor lately. A quiet sadness. A sense that when I tell him off — even gently — he doesn’t just hear correction. He hears shame.  

Like he’s thinking:  
_“Why am I like this?”_  
_“Why can’t I be better for Dad?”_

And that breaks my heart.  
Because I’ve tried not to place expectations on him.  
But he’s a child. And children absorb everything.  
He senses when my energy is low, when I’m stretched thin, and like so many kids — he thinks it must be his fault.

It’s not. It never is.  
I keep reminding him of that. Out loud.  
But I can feel how hard he’s trying. Trying to be easier. Trying to be "better."  
Trying to keep the peace with a parent who’s doing his best — but running on fumes.

There’s guilt in me. Some shame, too.  
Because I know he’s not as happy in himself at the moment. And I know some of that is because I haven’t been able to show up fully.  

But I also know this:  
**I’m doing my best not to pass that down.**  
And that means something. It matters.

I can’t be everything all the time.  
But I can take care of myself *before* I burn out — because when I burn out, I’m no good to anyone.  
Not to him. Not to me.

It’s a difficult tightrope to walk — guilt on one side, love on the other.  
But I’m walking it as best I can.  
And I’m grateful I have some support. I’m not completely alone.  
Even if it still feels heavy sometimes.

This is the work.  
This is love.
