Trust is a fragile thing.

Once broken, it doesn’t rebuild easily. Not with others. Not even with ourselves.

We say we want to love again, open again, try again — but something in us flinches. Pulls back. Hides. And not because we’re weak… but because we’ve been wounded.

And yet, there’s a quiet truth underneath it all:

> We want to trust. We *need* to trust. Because without trust, we don’t feel safe. And without safety, we can’t fully live.

But here’s the thing — trust doesn’t have to come back all at once.

It can start small:
- Letting someone see you when you’re struggling.
- Believing a kind word without brushing it off.
- Sitting with discomfort instead of running from it.

Learning to trust again isn’t a big, dramatic leap — it’s a series of gentle choices. To stay. To try. To believe that not everyone will hurt you. And more importantly… that *you* won’t abandon yourself again either.

Sometimes, it starts with trusting your own voice. The whisper that says:

> “I deserve more.”  
> “I don’t need to earn love.”  
> “I am safe now.”

Rebuilding trust means making space for all of you — even the scared parts. Especially the scared parts. Because those are the ones that need the most reassurance.

You might not trust easily. You might still flinch. But that doesn’t mean you’re broken. It means you’re healing. Slowly. Bravely.

And every time you soften — even just a little — that’s trust returning.
