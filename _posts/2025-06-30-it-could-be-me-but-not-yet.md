description: A reflection on knowing you're capable of stepping into something—while still choosing to wait until you're more deeply rooted.
emotions: [longing, acceptance]

I know I could do it.

I see people online every day—sharing their thoughts, offering sessions, building businesses from Instagram stories. And some of them are helping people. Some are doing it ethically. Some are clearly not. But still… I feel it. That tug in my chest. *That could be me.*

And yet, it isn’t. Not yet.

Not because I’m not ready in skill or insight—I feel capable. I know I could hold space for someone. I know I could make something meaningful. But there are things I want to build *behind the scenes* first. Not because they’re prerequisites, but because I want to feel solid enough in myself that when I do step forward, it’s with gravity. Not performance.

Right now, my way of earning money is new. Poker feels promising—and freeing—but emotionally, it’s still fragile. Not because I can’t do it, but because it touches something deep: safety, permission, worth. I want that part to feel a little more rooted before I take on the emotional weight of holding space for others.

And more than that—I want real friendships. Relationships that reflect the kind of healing I hope to support in others. Because although I *could* work with clients without that, something in me says… *wait.* Wait until you’ve built a life that reflects the kind of connection you believe in.

Because helping people isn’t just about insight. It’s about resonance. And I want people to feel the truth of what I’m offering—not just in my words, but in my life.

So for now, I’ll keep building.

I’ll write.  
I’ll play.  
I’ll sit with what’s real.  
I’ll work on my own relationships.  
And maybe, I’ll make quiet content. Day-in-the-life footage with a voiceover. Not as a brand. But as a practice. As a way to stay connected to the unfolding.

Because I’m not trying to impress anyone.  
I’m just trying to live this life in a way that feels honest.  
And when it’s time to step out more fully—I’ll know.

But for now…  
It could be me.  
But not yet.
