**“Individuation is not a destination. It’s the process of becoming the person you were always meant to be — not despite your suffering, but through it.”**  
— Carl Jung (and me, probably, in a past life)

### What is Individuation?

Carl Jung described *individuation* as the process of becoming whole — of integrating the conscious and unconscious parts of the self. It’s not about becoming perfect. It’s about becoming real.

For me, individuation hasn’t been some grand spiritual awakening or linear transformation. It's been more like an emotional archaeology — excavating the buried, forgotten parts of myself and learning to sit beside them without flinching.

It’s been raw. It’s been quiet. It’s been sacred.

### The Masks I Wore

As a child, I learned early that who I was wasn’t quite acceptable. I became “good,” compliant, careful. I wore masks that helped me survive — masks of self-reliance, masks of humour, masks of detachment.

But masks protect *and* disconnect.

In Jungian terms, I over-identified with the *persona* — the social self — and left my deeper, truer self behind in the shadows. And the longer I left him there, the louder he began to cry out — through anxiety, coping behaviours, shame, and a haunting sense of *something missing*.

That “something missing” was me.

### Meeting the Shadow

The turning point came when I stopped running from the parts of me I was taught to hide: rage, grief, fear, tenderness. What Jung called the *shadow*.

I used to think the shadow was something bad — a dark, dangerous place. But it turns out, the shadow isn’t evil. It’s just *exiled*. It’s where I stored everything that didn’t feel safe to express.

My individuation began the moment I turned toward those parts with curiosity rather than criticism. I started noticing the child inside me who still needed to be held. I stopped trying to “fix” my sadness and began asking what it needed.

### Integration: A Quiet Revolution

Individuation isn’t about becoming someone new. It’s about remembering who you were before the world told you who to be.

And it’s not a solo journey — even though it often feels like one. Along the way, I’ve needed support. I’ve leaned on therapy, writing, reflection, silence. I’ve created this blog as a mirror, a map, and sometimes just a place to say, *“Me too.”*

The more I honour the child within me, the more I notice how much I was seeking from others what I could only give myself: presence, understanding, protection.

That’s what individuation means to me.

Not perfection. Not enlightenment.

Just self-honesty. And slowly, over time… self-trust.

### If You’re On This Path Too

You might feel lost. You might feel like no one understands. But you’re not broken — you’re *unfolding*.

Individuation isn’t a straight path. It twists, circles, even vanishes at times. But if you’re here, reading this, chances are you’ve already started.

And maybe that’s all we need to do:  
Keep showing up.  
Keep listening inward.  
Keep becoming more whole, one piece at a time.

If that’s true, then maybe I’ve just begun living.
