I think I’ve been acting out projections from my childhood for most of my life without realizing it.

Not in some dramatic, obvious way — but in the everyday moments where I shrink, apologize too much, or feel like I’ve made some unforgivable mistake just by being human.

Today it hit me: I’m still carrying the belief that if I mess up, I’ll be mocked, abandoned, or punished.

That belief wasn’t born from nowhere. It came from the home I grew up in — where mistakes weren’t met with warmth or curiosity, but with shame. Where I had to keep the adults emotionally regulated just so I wouldn’t be targeted. Where my own emotional reality never really existed in the room.

So now, even when something completely ordinary happens — like calling the garage and needing to double-check a delivery — my whole body flips. I brace for the worst. I fawn. I thank them too much. I act like I’ve committed some great sin, when all I’ve done is ask a reasonable question.

It’s not about them. It’s about what they represent in my psyche.

The guy on the phone isn’t a threat. He’s just a man doing his job. But the second my nervous system perceives him as *someone with authority*, I’m not 35 anymore. I’m 8. And I’m terrified of getting it wrong.

I’ve started to see this pattern more clearly lately. And it’s not just in practical situations — it’s in my relationships, too.

I’ve often coaxed vulnerability out of others — made them feel safe enough to share — not just because I care (though I do), but because it means I don’t have to share myself.

If they’re open, I can stay hidden.

And then I resent them for not asking about me — even though I’ve unconsciously trained them not to.  
It’s a loop I didn’t know I was in.

I think the biggest shift is this: I finally feel safe enough in my body to start seeing *my role in these dynamics* — not with blame, but with compassion.

Yes, I’ve been keeping people at arm’s length.  
Yes, I’ve fawned in the face of perceived authority.  
Yes, I’ve projected old fears onto present-day situations.

But I’m also waking up to the fact that I don’t have to keep doing that. I’m not a child anymore.

My neighbour — the one who’s taken advantage of my fawning nature more than once — I won’t stand for that anymore. And with strangers who resemble old authority figures, I’m learning to pause, to breathe, to *choose* how I respond instead of collapsing into shame.

It’s not perfect. It still feels almost uncontrollable at times. But I’m noticing. I’m interrupting. And that alone is powerful.

I don’t want to keep talking about how bad my childhood was. But the truth is, it still affects my day-to-day life.

And the more I reflect, the more I realize just how much I lost — not just in terms of emotional safety, but in terms of relationships that never had a chance to grow, because I didn’t know how to be seen.

It’s a painful realization. But it’s also a doorway.

Because now, I do want to be seen.  
Not for performance, not for trauma — but for who I really am, in all my ordinary humanness.

I’m not trying to fix it all at once. But I am trying to show up differently — even if that starts with something as small as holding my ground in a conversation, or noticing when I start to fawn.

My body still believes I’m a child.  
But I’m not.  
And that knowing is where it starts to shift.
