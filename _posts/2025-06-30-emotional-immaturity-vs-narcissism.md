Lately, I’ve been sitting with a quiet but painful feeling — the sense that my tutors must have viewed me as somehow *unsafe* to work with clients. That’s the impression I’ve been left with after being rejected from Level 4 counselling training without clear feedback.

And when there’s silence, the mind fills the gaps. It’s hard not to project all the worst-case meanings into that space. Did I come across as too intense? Too open? Too much?

But here’s what I’m starting to realize: these kinds of decisions often aren’t about truth. They’re about *risk management*. Institutions don't always have the emotional maturity to hold someone who doesn’t fit their mold. They may view openness — especially around complex mental health history — as a liability. Not because the person is dangerous, but because the system is limited.

Still, I would have appreciated the dignity of a clear explanation. When people don’t offer that, it can feel like a silent character assassination. Like being judged in a room I wasn’t even invited into.

### On Narcissism (and the People We Label)

This ties into something else I’ve been noticing more broadly: the word *narcissist* is everywhere.

It seems to have become the default label for anyone who behaves in a way that feels selfish, manipulative, or emotionally distant. And while I understand the need to name harmful behavior, I think we’re often mistaking something else: **emotional immaturity**.

Many people are emotionally stunted — not out of malice, but because of trauma. Their responses (tantrums, stonewalling, passive aggression, control) aren’t signs of narcissistic personality disorder — they’re signs of undeveloped emotional skills.

And here’s the thing: **immaturity still hurts**. It can damage relationships and erode trust. But when we label someone as a narcissist, we often:
- Remove the possibility of growth,
- Position ourselves as emotionally superior,
- And lose sight of the human behind the behavior.

I’m not saying we should excuse the impact. But I *am* saying we might do better by calling it what it often is: **a lack of relational maturity**.

### What Emotional Maturity Actually Looks Like

A secure, emotionally mature person doesn’t need to dominate, belittle, or withdraw. They can:
- Name their feelings clearly,
- Set boundaries without cruelty,
- And respect someone else’s individuality, even when it’s uncomfortable.

Emotionally immature people often can’t do that — yet. But I think they can *learn*, even if slowly. And if we give up on them by labeling them permanently, we cut off that possibility.

The term *toxic* still holds weight for me — because it points to the *impact*. But I think it’s worth remembering that most toxic behavior comes from unhealed pain, not evil intent.

### A Final Thought

Maybe this whole journey — from being rejected, to questioning labels, to defining maturity — is about my own growth too.

Maybe I’m learning to trust that the way I see the world isn’t too much. That emotional depth is not a flaw. That my disappointment with others’ immaturity is really a mirror — showing me just how deeply I long for truth, respect, and mutual care.

And maybe one day, I’ll help build the spaces I wish had existed for me.
