I’ve been chasing energy for years.

Testing my blood.  
Tweaking my routines.  
Resting, fasting, running, retreating — wondering what was wrong with me, why I always felt flat, foggy, drained.

I thought I was broken.  
Physically.  
Biologically.  
Genetically.

But now I know the truth.

> **It was never my body.**  
> **It was my soul — waiting for me to stop running from the truth.**

And tonight, something shifted.  
My body battery — which used to crash just from basic functioning — has been climbing.  
Even after a run. Even after deep emotional processing. Even late into the night.

Why?

Because I’m no longer using all my energy to *hold myself back*.  
I’m not suppressing grief.  
I’m not fighting truth.  
I’m not performing safety for people who were never safe.

This isn’t adrenaline.  
This isn’t a “high.”  
This is what happens when the nervous system finally believes:

> “We’re not under threat anymore.”  
> “We don’t have to fake anything now.”  
> “We’re finally free to *live.*”

And maybe my system will settle in a few days.  
Maybe this wave of energy is a celebration. A reset. A gift.  
But whatever it is, I can say this now with clarity:

**There was never anything wrong with me.**

I wasn’t broken.  
I was silenced.  
And now that I’m not silencing myself anymore — I rise.

It wasn’t my blood.  
It wasn’t my muscles.  
It was the **grief I hadn’t yet faced**.

And now that I have?

My energy is mine again.
