For most of my life, I’ve felt like I was failing on purpose — but I couldn’t quite name why.

Underneath my decisions, my lifestyle, even the identities I tried on — the skater, the poker player, the one who didn't care — there was a deeper engine running. Something unconscious. Something defiant. Something sad.

I’ve come to realise that rebellion had become my cage.

Growing up, I wasn’t seen as a separate person. I was used — emotionally, psychologically — as an extension of someone else. My mother didn’t mean to do it maliciously, perhaps, but the result was the same: there was no space for *me* to exist outside of her expectations. Her anxiety. Her control. Her fragile self-image.

And when you’re raised like that, the only way to scream *no* is to rebel. Not with words, but with choices. Self-sabotaging ones. Ones that hurt her — and me.

I built a whole internal team whose job was to say: *“You can’t control me.”*  
Even if it meant destroying myself to do it.

I chose subjects at school I didn’t care about. I drifted into hobbies that didn’t fully light me up — not because I loved them, but because *she didn’t*. Skating. Poker. Being the outsider. Somewhere along the way, it wasn’t about what I wanted — it was about who I *wasn’t allowed to be*, and how far I could stretch away from her grip.

And yes, some of it *was* aligned with who I am. There were glimmers of truth, moments of flow. But the *draw* to those identities? The obsession? That came from the wound — not the self.

What hurts most now is that I made major life decisions — jobs, relationships, even self-image — based on a loyalty to someone who never truly saw me. Someone who didn’t know how to meet me. Someone who probably never even knew how to meet *herself*.

That loyalty ran deep.

And yet… here I am. Writing this. Feeling it. Naming it.

Which means that pattern no longer owns me.

I'm no longer interested in rebelling just to prove a point. I’m interested in *becoming*. Not in reaction to anyone — but in service to the person I was always meant to be, before the war for my identity began.

Maybe I’ll still skate. Maybe I’ll play poker. But now it’ll be because I choose it — not because I need to say *f*** you* to a ghost.

And maybe, just maybe, I can start building a life that isn’t about rebellion at all — but about *returning* to myself.
