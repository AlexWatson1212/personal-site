Can I safely embody power now, without it being tied to a label?

That question has been sitting with me lately.

Because for most of my life, power was something I had to *wear*—to survive, to be taken seriously, to stay safe.  
It was something reactive. Defensive. A way of saying, *“Don’t mess with me.”*  
It came from pain, from chaos, from needing to control what couldn’t be controlled.

But now I’m asking:  
What does power look like when I’m not defending myself?

And the answer feels simple—but deep.  
It looks like **presence**.

Not just any presence—but something grounded.  
Something calm.  
Something people feel more than see.  
A kind of energy that doesn’t need to posture, doesn’t need to react.  
It just *is*.

Sometimes it feels masculine—strong, rooted, still.  
Sometimes it feels feminine—open, receptive, wise.  
Often it’s both.

It’s in my body language.  
It’s in how I carry myself.  
It’s even in my heart rate—the way I stay calm in the face of tension, not because I’m numb, but because I trust myself now.

That, to me, is **true power**.

And when I really strip it down, I think the word that captures it best is this:

**Responsibility.**

To embody power is to take responsibility for how I respond.  
Not to control everything, but to meet whatever arises with presence.  
To hold steady.  
To stay connected to myself.

That kind of power doesn’t need a label.  
It doesn’t need to be announced.  
It doesn’t even need to be explained.

It’s just there—quietly shaping the room,  
because I’m finally rooted in who I am.
