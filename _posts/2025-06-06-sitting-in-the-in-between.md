The quiet space between leaving what hurt  
and finding what heals  
can feel empty —  
but it’s where your truest self begins to form.

I’ve left the roles that drained me.  
I’ve stopped chasing the love that never held me.  
But now I’m here… and it’s quiet.

This is the **in-between**.  
No longer who I was.  
Not yet who I’m becoming.

And it’s hard.  
Not because I want to go back —  
but because I don’t know what forward looks like yet.

### 🌫 This Isn’t Failure — It’s Fertile

There’s a grief in this space.  
Not the grief of loss, but the grief of **letting go**  
without knowing what will take its place.

And still —  
this is where something new can begin.

This is where you meet yourself,  
not as a role,  
but as a human.

Where silence becomes soil.  
Where you stop performing  
and start listening.

### 🕊 Learning to Stay

I used to fill these gaps:  
With distraction.  
With people.  
With overworking.  
With self-doubt disguised as productivity.

Now —  
I just sit.  
And breathe.  
And let the ache speak.

> *“I’m not lost.  
I’m just in between.”*

And that’s okay.

> ✏️ **Final Reflection:**  
> What would it look like to honour this in-between season instead of rushing through it?
