Not everything needs to be controlled.

Not every moment needs to be productive.  
Not every feeling needs to be fixed.  
Not every uncertainty needs to be solved right now.

Sometimes, the most powerful thing we can do is trust the tide.

The natural rhythm of life — of healing, of growth, of letting go — isn’t linear. It moves in waves. Forward, backward, sideways. Sometimes still. Sometimes crashing.

> We weren’t made to be in constant motion.  
> We were made to flow.

Trusting the tide means allowing space for:
- Rest after a surge of effort.
- Stillness in the middle of figuring things out.
- Grief even in moments of joy.
- Joy even in seasons of grief.

It means believing that just because you’re not *doing* doesn’t mean you’re not *becoming*.

It means surrendering to timing — your own, not the world’s.

The tide knows how to return. It always does. And so will you.

So if today feels uncertain, slow, or off-track… maybe you’re not stuck. Maybe you’re just between waves.

Breathe. Trust. Float if you must.

**You don’t have to fight the current. You can trust the tide to carry you — even when you don’t yet know where it’s going.**
