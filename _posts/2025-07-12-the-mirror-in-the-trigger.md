Sometimes the people who trigger me the most are the ones holding up a mirror.

It doesn’t feel like that at first — it feels like *they’re wrong*. They’re annoying. They’re playing the victim, they’re pushing too hard, they’re rescuing when no one asked.

But beneath the surface, something deeper is going on.

### The Mother and the Helper

There was a moment recently involving a parent who, to me, came across as playing the victim — using their child as a kind of emotional crutch for their shame. It hit a nerve. I felt irritated, activated.

Another person in the interaction was validating her, offering solutions, kind of enabling it.

And it really got to me.

But when I stepped back, I saw something else:

- I’ve also played the victim at times. I’ve wanted to be rescued. I’ve leaned into helplessness to avoid facing something painful.  
- I’ve also been the helper — trying to fix, validate, offer advice before people have even asked.  
- And I’ve also leaned on others emotionally, including my child, to regulate shame I didn’t yet know how to hold.

The parts of them that triggered me? They’re also parts of me I’ve had trouble accepting. And instead of seeing them with compassion, I projected my own unintegrated shame outward.

### The Professional Dynamic

I also noticed myself getting triggered by someone I once worked with in a professional support role. And again, when I reflected, I realized:

> I get a certain validation from helping people.  
> I take pride in the growth I see in others, especially if I’ve played a role.  
> But sometimes, deep down, there’s a need in me — *to feel valuable through their progress*.

That need has sometimes come from insecurity.  
It’s not inherently bad — it just needs to be seen.  
Owned. Loved.

The trigger wasn’t just about them.  
It was about the parts of myself I hadn’t yet fully accepted.

### The One Who Pushed Too Hard

There was another moment — someone in a position of authority who pushed me to face something I wasn’t ready to face. It felt invasive. Disrespectful. Misattuned.

But again — I’ve been that person too.

There are times when I’ve pushed people before they were ready. Times when I’ve led people into insights they didn’t ask for — not because they needed it, but because *I needed to feel like I helped*.

That part of me still lives inside me. And it needs to be held — not rejected.

### The Mirror in the Trigger

This doesn’t mean every reaction is projection.  
Sometimes people are genuinely out of line.  
But **when the trigger feels disproportionate — intense, hot, sticky — it’s usually a mirror**.

It’s a part of me saying:
> *“You haven’t loved this part of us yet.”*

The rescuer.  
The victim.  
The fixer.  
The pusher.  
The one who needs to be needed.

They all live in me.

And the more I accept them — not shame them, not indulge them, but love them — the more I can meet others with clarity instead of projection.

### So Now?

I’m watching my triggers with softer eyes.  
I’m asking:
> *“Is this really about them?”*  
> *“Or is this a part of me still waiting to be seen?”*

And the answer isn’t always easy.  
But it’s honest.

And that’s how I know I’m healing.
