description: I’m starting to see what it truly cost me to stay loyal to someone who never loved me. And while I grieve that, I’m also learning not to carry shame for surviving the only way I knew how.
emotions: [grief, shame]

It’s hard to admit how long I let it go on for.

How long I held onto the hope that maybe — just maybe — she’d change. That if I was good enough, quiet enough, kind enough, she’d finally meet me where I needed her to.

I see it now for what it was.  
Not love.  
Not family.  
Not safety.

Just survival.  
And it cost me almost everything.

There’s a part of me that feels ashamed.  
Ashamed that I stayed.  
Ashamed that I kept showing up.  
Ashamed that I kept opening the door, again and again, to someone who never once truly walked through it.

But I know where that shame comes from —  
It comes from **her voice**, not mine.  
From a lifetime of being told that my worth was tied to how well I kept the peace.  
From believing that staying quiet was love, and leaving was betrayal.

I don’t carry that belief anymore.  
But some days, the residue still sticks.

What it cost me:

- My sanity, at times  
- The intimacy I longed for, but never trusted  
- The friendships I couldn’t fully receive because I was still proving my value elsewhere  
- And most painfully… it cost me **myself**.

The version of me who could’ve flourished sooner.  
The version of me who never got to exist because I was too busy managing *her emotions*.

That’s the grief I’m sitting with now.

---

But I also see this:

> I shouldn’t feel ashamed of that version of me — the one who stayed.  
> I should feel proud of the version of me who finally stood up and said **no more**.

Because that part of me wasn’t weak — he was surviving.  
And this version of me — the one writing these words — is reclaiming what was lost.

I may never get back what I missed.  
But I will never again give myself away to someone who doesn’t know what love is.

What it cost me to stay was everything.  
But what I gain by leaving is finally… **me**.
