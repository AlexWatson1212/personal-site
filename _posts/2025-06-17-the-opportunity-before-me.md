I just took third place in a $100 hyper — and yeah, the result is nice. But that’s not what stuck with me.

What stayed with me was **how I played**.

- I made folds that others wouldn’t.
- I held my nerve when stacks were short and mistakes were contagious.
- I watched others panic in real time — players I know are profitable — and I didn’t follow them.

That’s what makes this feel different.

I’ve analysed hands in the moment. I’ve felt the stress rise — and stayed present. ICM didn’t shake me. Laddering wasn’t luck. It was *knowing the moment*, *knowing the edge*, *trusting the fold*.

The deeper truth here is: I’m not just hoping anymore. I’m playing.

This is a window. A glimpse of what’s possible when I bring my whole self to the game — not just the theory, not just the ambition, but the **emotional mastery** I’ve been developing for years.

I’m not here to chase every pot. I’m here to carve out an edge that’s deeper, quieter, and longer-lasting.

This isn’t about the $100 tournament.

It’s about the opportunity before me — and the fact that, for once, I’m not letting it pass.
