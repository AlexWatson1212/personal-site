I’ve been thinking about how I’ve shown up in relationships —  
Not just romantic ones, but friendships, neighbours, classmates, even passing strangers.

And what I’ve come to realise is:  
> I’ve kept my distance.  
> Not because I don’t care.  
> But because I *care too much* — and somewhere deep down, I believed I was too wounded to be close.

### 🧠 How the Wound Shows Up

When your childhood teaches you that love is confusing, conditional, or absent —  
you start seeing the world through that same lens.

A cold look becomes rejection.  
A silence becomes abandonment.  
A kind gesture becomes suspicious.

You begin projecting what happened *then* onto who’s in front of you *now*.

I think I’ve been doing that my whole life.  
Not maliciously — just unconsciously.  
And when I caught glimpses of that, I felt so ashamed, I withdrew even more.

### 😔 The Narrative I Carried

I told myself:

- *“I can’t trust my reactions.”*  
- *“I don’t want to hurt anyone.”*  
- *“Better to stay away than let the shame creep in again.”*

So I isolated.  
From friendships.  
From community.  
From love.

And I wore that distance like armor.

But the truth is:  
> I wasn’t dangerous.  
> I was just afraid — and completely unprepared for closeness that didn’t come with fear attached.

### 🪞 Where It All Comes From

When your mother never loved you in a way that felt safe…  
When your father kept love at a distance, or buried it in silence…  
You grow up believing that *your presence is a threat* —  
Or that others can’t be trusted to hold you.

So you perform.  
Withdraw.  
Or shut down completely.

And then you blame yourself for not being better at connection.

### 🩹 The Grief Beneath the Shame

I look back and I see moments where I hurt people without meaning to.  
Times I disappeared.  
Times I clung on.  
Times I froze.

I can’t undo any of that.  
But I can forgive the boy inside me who was doing the only thing he knew:

> Protecting himself from pain — and protecting others from what he feared was his own brokenness.

It wasn’t brokenness.  
It was grief, confusion, survival.

### 💬 Why I’ve Kept My Distance

I thought I was protecting them.  
Maybe I was just trying to survive.  
Maybe this is what happens when your earliest love leaves you questioning your own worth.

But I want to stop abandoning myself now.  
Even in moments of shame.  
Even when the old stories return.

I don’t need to be perfect to be present.

And maybe, just maybe —  
Closeness can still be safe.

But only if I let go of the lie that distance is the only way to do no harm.
