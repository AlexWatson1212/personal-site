Lately I’ve found myself pulled into something I used to avoid—  
religious debates.  
Christianity vs Islam.  
YouTube speakers, public showdowns, conversions caught on camera.

At first, I wasn’t sure if I was just following toxic content.  
It felt a little extreme, a little performative.  
But I stayed with it—not to be entertained, but to **observe**, question, and learn.

What I found surprised me.

## The Debater and the Easy Win

There’s one Christian apologist in particular who seems to win nearly every debate.  
He’s confident, well-read, quick with references.  
On the surface, he *looks like truth*.  
But I’ve come to see he’s just very good at debate.  
And the people he often debates with?  
They’re not always equally prepared.

It started to feel like easy pickings—especially when challenging Islamic ideology, which (let’s be honest) has some real holes in it.

## But It's Not Just About Who Wins

Over time, I started noticing something deeper:
- Many of the people converting in these videos weren’t *convinced*—they were **vulnerable**.
- They were moving from one certainty to another—not because they had found truth, but because they couldn’t bear to sit in uncertainty.
- Christianity felt like a softer place to land.

And while I do personally believe Christianity is, on balance, **less harmful to society than Islam**,  
I don’t believe *any* religion holds the full truth.

They each have value.  
They each have shadow.  
And they all—at their core—**offer an escape from the terror of not knowing why we’re here.**

## My Issues with Islamic Ideology

I want to be specific and respectful here.

I have no hatred toward Muslim people.  
I respect many aspects of the faith—discipline, modesty, devotion, family structure.

But I **do** take issue with some core teachings that are still widely held:
- Sharia law practices that include cutting off hands,  
- The death penalty for apostasy,  
- The legitimisation of child marriage,  
- The systemic oppression of women in many interpretations.

These aren't fringe views.  
They're embedded in the doctrine in ways that concern me—particularly when large populations begin to advocate for Sharia as law, even in non-Islamic countries.

That crosses a line for me.  
Not because I hate religion,  
but because **I love human dignity**.

## Where I Land

If I were to choose a religion, it would likely be Buddhism.  
Its quiet emphasis on self-awareness, compassion, and detachment resonates most.

I also hold deep respect for Sikhs, and for individuals of any faith who live with integrity.

But I no longer believe the only path to a moral, grounded life is through religion.  
And I don’t believe debate is the best way to arrive at truth.

I believe in:
- Reflective thought,  
- Quiet discernment,  
- And sitting with things long enough to **know what you actually believe—not what you were pressured into saying.**

## Final Thought

I used to avoid all this—religion, politics, belief systems—because I hadn’t thought enough to speak.  
Now I see that **not speaking too early was a strength**, not a failure.

I’ve taken my time.  
I’m still taking it.  
And I’m slowly forming a framework of belief—not because I need to be right,  
but because I need to live with myself.

And that’s enough.
