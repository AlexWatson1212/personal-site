Today I cashed for $200 in a bounty tournament, and while it might not sound like much, I’m honestly proud of how I played. It wasn’t about running hot, or hitting big hands at the right time. It was about **holding my nerve** when it mattered most — and that’s where the real growth lives.

### The Bubble Phase

I found myself hovering just above the danger zone, with a short stack, watching other players panic or overreach. At one point, I had to fold hands like **Ace-Queen**, **Ace-Jack**, and even **Ace-King** — hands that would normally be slam-dunk jams or calls.

But this wasn’t a normal spot.

This was the ICM bubble.

And **one bad decision** — one mistimed shove — would’ve meant going home with nothing.

So I waited.

I watched players with bigger stacks than mine throw their tournament lives away with reckless calls and wide shoves, and I reminded myself:  
> “It’s not about how strong the hand is — it’s about how dangerous the spot is.”

### Cashing Through Patience

Eventually, the short stacks busted. The money bubble burst. And I was still alive.

It might have looked passive from the outside, but every fold was a conscious, difficult choice. Every pause, a battle against ego.  
**It’s not easy folding AK on a short stack.**  
It’s not easy trusting that survival — not action — is the most profitable move in that moment.

But I did. And it paid off.

### The Final Hand

With about 1.5 big blinds left, I picked up a playable hand. I flopped trip threes — a miracle — but got cracked by a straight on the river.

And I was okay with it.

Because I didn’t go out on tilt. I didn’t punt.  
I went out knowing I’d played the bubble **exactly how I needed to**.

### Long-Term Perspective

This is where real tournament profit comes from.  
Not the flashy bluffs or the wild hero calls — but the quiet, gritty decisions in high-pressure moments:

- Folding good hands
- Watching others make mistakes
- Trusting that the math and timing are on your side

It may not look dramatic. It may even seem boring.

But these are the hands — or non-hands — that **build a winning career**.

---

### Final Thought

> “It may look straightforward, but holding your nerve in those situations is not as easy as it looks.”

This was one of those days where I earned every chip.  
And that $200 cash? That’s just the start.
