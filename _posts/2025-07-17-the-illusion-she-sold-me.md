For most of my life, I tried to be someone I wasn’t — not because I lacked identity, but because the version of me that existed outside her story was always met with confusion, discomfort, or outright rejection.

She sold me an illusion:  
That she was a good mother.  
That her love was unconditional.  
That I was ungrateful, difficult, hard to buy for.

She needed those beliefs more than she ever needed a real relationship with me.  
She needed to feel like she had done her best.  
She needed me to *perform* gratitude, even when my nervous system was in survival mode.  
And when I stopped performing, when I started asking for truth, for accountability — I became the villain.

I reached out again recently. Not with anger, but with clarity. I offered her a path — one last door into something honest.  
But she chose silence.  
Not because I was cruel, but because I was no longer controllable. Because truth threatens illusion.  
Because I was finally strong enough to say: *this doesn’t work for me anymore.*

She once bought me a house after I came out of psychosis. Not because I asked for love — I asked for distance.  
And she gave me property. A guilt gift. A final attempt to preserve the illusion of being generous, good, caring.  
But real love doesn’t arrive with strings attached or the hope of public applause.  
Real love says, *I’m sorry.* Real love says, *tell me how I hurt you.*  
She never said those words.

Now I sit with the quiet reality that I’ll probably never see her again. And you know what?  
That reality is softer than the lie I lived inside for 35 years.  
Because I’m no longer contorting myself to keep someone comfortable in their denial.

She always said I was hard to buy for.  
But the truth is: she never tried to know me.

And now, for the first time, I’m beginning to know myself — outside the illusion.  
And there is peace in that.

Even if it comes wrapped in grief.
