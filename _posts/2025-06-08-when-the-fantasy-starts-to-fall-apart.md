There’s a strange kind of grief that hits you when you realise the life you were building with someone wasn’t really built on connection — but on *projection*.

We were drawn to each other, I think, not because we deeply knew one another…  
But because, in some unspoken way, we both *didn’t*.  
That felt safe.

And in that blank space, we could both imagine the partner we always wanted.

### 🪞 What We Saw in Each Other

Looking back, maybe the unconscious draw was this:

> *If we never really get to know each other, we don’t have to risk being disappointed.*

She saw me as her rescue — her chance to finally become the version of herself she longed to be:  
Married, stable, “chosen.”  
She started arranging the wedding, the story, the life — without asking if I was truly there with her in it.

And for a while, I let it happen.  
Because I was projecting too.

### 💔 When Therapy Starts to Change You

The more therapy I did, the more I wanted something real.  
Not the image. Not the performance. Not the future we were supposed to walk into.

I wanted someone who could *hold me*.  
Emotionally.  
Intimately.  
Humanly.

And the more I wanted that, the more I realised:  
> *She couldn’t.*

Not because she was cruel.  
But because she wasn’t emotionally available in the way I needed.  
She didn’t ask.  
She didn’t see.  
She didn’t *meet me*.

And I think, deep down, I had always felt that.

### 🧠 Did I Push Her Away?

That question haunted me for a long time.  
But now I think the truth is this:

> *I didn’t push her away. I just stopped playing along.*

Stopped pretending the connection was deep when it was mostly imagined.  
Stopped carrying the fantasy.  
Stopped waiting for intimacy to arrive where it had never really been planted.

And when I stopped pretending, the distance revealed itself.

### 🩹 The Sadness That Lingers

We had a child.  
We built a life.  
We shared years.

And still, I never felt truly known.  
Not past the surface.  
Not past the story.

That’s the sadness that lingers — not just what was lost, but what was never really *found*.

### 🕯 What I Know Now

What we had was a fantasy — one we both created to escape old pain.  
But fantasies can’t hold real people.  
And the more real I became, the more the illusion collapsed.

I don’t regret the time.  
But I grieve what we tried to make out of loneliness and longing.

And I honour the part of me that stopped pretending —  
even when it cost me the story I thought I wanted.
