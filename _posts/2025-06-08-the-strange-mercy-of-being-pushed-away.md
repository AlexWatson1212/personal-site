Iâ€™ve been carrying a quiet kind of grief lately.

Not loud.  
Not overwhelming.  
Just heavy.

Itâ€™s the grief that comes when you realize youâ€™ll never get to speak to your father *as an adult*.  
Not man-to-man.  
Not heart-to-heart.  
Not now that you finally have the language for the things you once only *felt*.

### ðŸ’” The Unlived Relationship

Iâ€™ve accepted that my mum never loved me in the way I needed. That grief, strangely, has settled.  
But my dadâ€¦ heâ€™s harder.

Because I *felt* something in him.  
A gentleness he couldnâ€™t quite show.  
A love that got buried beneath coldness.  
And something in me has always believed â€” he pushed me away on purpose.

Not to hurt me.  
But to save me.

### ðŸ”„ The Paradox Thatâ€™s Hard to Hold

He treated me with disdain. Made home unbearable.  
And yet, part of me believes he did that to *force me to leave*.  
Because leaving was the only way Iâ€™d be safe.  
The only way Iâ€™d get a real chance.

That kind of love â€” if thatâ€™s what it was â€” is hard to receive.  
Harder still to forgive.

It wasnâ€™t fair.  
It hurt.  
But maybe, in his own broken way, it *was mercy*.

### ðŸ§© Sorting Through the Emotional Debris

I donâ€™t want to keep revisiting this to punish myself or romanticize him.  
I just want to understand the scraps â€” to clear them from my nervous system so they donâ€™t haunt future relationships.

Because being pushed away â€” even with good intentions â€” still leaves a scar.  
It plants a seed of doubt: *Am I loveable up close? Or only from afar?*

I want to know that I can be chosen *and* kept.

### ðŸ§’ To the Boy I Was

You didnâ€™t deserve to be pushed out.  
Even if it helped you grow.  
Even if it led you somewhere safer.

You deserved to be *guided*, not cast aside.  
You deserved softness, not confusion.  
And you were *never* a burden.

### ðŸ’¬ A Letter Iâ€™ll Never Send

> Dad,  
> I wish we could have spoken now.  
> As I am. As you were.  
> I think I would have understood you more.  
> And maybe you would have seen I turned out okay.  
> 
> I donâ€™t know if you pushed me away to save me.  
> But if you did â€” thank you.  
> 
> Still, I carry the ache of being sent away without explanation.  
> And I wish weâ€™d found another way.  
> 
> I forgive you â€” not because it didnâ€™t hurt,  
> but because holding it forever will only deepen the wound.  
> 
> You gave me life. Now Iâ€™m learning how to live it.  
> On my terms.  
> With softness.  
> With love.

Some days, I still feel the weight of what couldâ€™ve been.  
But I also feel the strength of what Iâ€™ve made from it.

And maybe thatâ€™s the strange mercy after all.
