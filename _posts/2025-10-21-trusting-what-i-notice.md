I’ve been thinking a lot about how I listen. Not just to words, but to the tone underneath, the pauses, the facial expressions, the feeling that lives behind what’s being said.  

For a long time I thought I had to bring all of this into the room. That if I didn’t, I wasn’t showing how attentive I really was. Almost like I had to prove that I was listening harder than anyone else. But I’m realising that’s not the point.  

The point isn’t to interpret everything. The point is to notice, and then decide: *is this useful right now?*  
Sometimes the best thing to do is simply hold it in the background. Other times it might be as simple as saying: *“I noticed this. Is it important to you, or should we move on?”* That keeps the client in charge of meaning.  

I’m learning to trust my unconscious to surface what matters. Not everything I pick up on needs to be made conscious. Most of the time, being with someone is straightforward and simple. The depth is always there if it’s needed, but I don’t have to force it.  

That’s the balance: curiosity that serves the client versus curiosity that complicates things.  
- If it helps the client, bring it in.  
- If it risks making them anxious or insecure, hold it silently.  

This is becoming less about proving I can see everything, and more about being with someone in the moment. And as I grow into that, I’m finding myself enjoying class more each week. That enjoyment is proof of resilience — not dramatic, just the quiet kind that shows up when I feel more comfortable in my own skin.  

**Mantra I want to carry with me:**  
*I don’t need to use everything I notice. I just need to trust myself to use what’s useful.*
