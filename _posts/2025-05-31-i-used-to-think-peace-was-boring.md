I used to mistake peace for boredom.

If things were calm—no drama, no intensity, no emotional rollercoaster—I’d feel restless. I’d create problems, overthink, seek stimulation, or stir something up… just to feel something.

Looking back, I realise I wasn’t bored. I was uncomfortable.

Because peace felt unfamiliar. And familiar wasn’t always safe—it was chaos, walking on eggshells, bracing for rejection. So anything outside of that felt… empty.

But peace isn’t empty.  
It’s *spacious.*

It’s the feeling of not needing to prove anything.  
Of not having to chase or manage someone else’s emotions.  
Of waking up without dread in my chest.

Peace has become the new exciting.

And the more I allow it, the more I see it for what it really is—not boredom, not blandness, but freedom.

And I’m learning to let that be enough.
