There was a time when losing a big hand would throw my entire day off. I’d replay it over and over, curse the river card, question my ability, and spiral into self-doubt.

But something’s changed.

I still care. Of course I do. But I don’t collapse. I don’t rage quit. I don’t let one hand define my worth.

Now, when I take a bad beat, I take a breath. I log the hand. I review it later. I remind myself: if I made the right decision, I can live with the result.

Poker’s become a mirror. It shows me where I’m grounded—and where I’m not. It reflects how I handle chaos. How I deal with luck. How I recover from disappointment.

And lately, I’m proud of what I’m seeing.

My nervous system is steadier. My self-talk is kinder. My attachment to outcome is loosening. I’m not trying to prove I’m good—I’m just trying to play well. Big difference.

The game didn’t become less volatile. I just became more regulated.

And it shows.
