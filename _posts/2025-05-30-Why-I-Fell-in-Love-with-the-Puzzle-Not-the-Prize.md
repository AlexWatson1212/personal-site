I used to play a game that involved a lot of decision-making under pressure.

At first, I thought winning would prove something — that I was good enough, smart enough, or maybe just worthy of something I hadn’t yet received. I chased outcomes. I watched the scoreboard. Every success was a brief sigh of relief. Every loss echoed something deeper.

But something shifted.

Over time, I realised the game wasn’t really about winning. Not for me.  
It was about *solving the puzzle*.

Every hand became a moment to sit with uncertainty. To think clearly. To act with integrity even when the outcome was out of my control.

It taught me when to wait.  
When to trust my gut.  
When to walk away — not because I was afraid, but because it was the right thing to do.

These lessons didn’t stay in the game.

They followed me into my relationships. Into parenting. Into moments where the “correct” choice wasn’t always obvious, and I had to act anyway.

It’s strange how something that once felt like a contest slowly became something more reflective. More revealing. More human.

I’m not chasing wins anymore.  
I’m here for the process.  
For the chance to grow.

And that, in itself, is the win.
