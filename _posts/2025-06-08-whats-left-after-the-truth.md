You face the truth.  
You name the wound.  
You stop defending them.  
You let the illusions die.

And thenâ€¦

Youâ€™re just tired.  
Not healed.  
Not free.  
Just empty.

### ðŸ§± What I Thought Would Happen

I thought thereâ€™d be some kind of clarity.  
Some release.  
Maybe even a sense of pride for having faced it all so directly.

Instead, what I feel is more like collapse.  
Like the adrenaline of lifelong hope just ran out.  
Like I opened a door that led not to light, but to silence.

Itâ€™s not despair.  
Itâ€™s not rage.

Itâ€™s the dull ache of nothing.  
The quiet aftermath of surviving your own childhood with your eyes finally open.

### ðŸ•³ The Void Where Hope Used to Live

I donâ€™t want to engage with my mother again.  
That feels clear now.

But my fatherâ€¦  
Thatâ€™s the more painful one.

Because part of me still wants to believe he loved me.  
That the warmth I felt, even if only in fragments, *meant something*.  
And maybe it did â€” to him. But that doesnâ€™t mean it landed in me.  
It didnâ€™t hold me.  
It didnâ€™t protect me.  
It left me confused.

And now I sit with that confusion, no longer trying to resolve it.

### ðŸ§  Was It All Projection?

Maybe the love I thought I felt from him wasnâ€™t about *him* at all.  
Maybe it was a child trying to hold onto *something* â€” anything â€” that felt softer than what my mother gave me.

Maybe his distance mirrored how he handled *his* mother.  
Maybe I inherited not love â€” but a system of managing neglect.

I donâ€™t know.  
And thatâ€™s part of the grief: *thereâ€™s no answer coming.*

### ðŸ’¬ The Hardest Truth

> If he had just loved me clearly, that might have been enough to keep me okay.

Not special.  
Not perfect.  
Just *okay*.

But the fact that it was so crypticâ€¦ so indirectâ€¦ so lost in silence and distanceâ€¦  
Thatâ€™s what damaged my self-trust.  
Thatâ€™s what makes relationships so hard.  
Thatâ€™s what leaves the hole.

### ðŸª¨ Whatâ€™s Left?

Whatâ€™s left after the truth is this:

- Fatigue  
- A strange peace that feels more like absence  
- A rawness I donâ€™t know how to dress  
- A quieter relationship with hope

And maybeâ€¦  
Just maybeâ€¦  
That emptiness isnâ€™t a failure.

Maybe itâ€™s the beginning of something cleaner.  
Not better.  
But more *real*.

---

I donâ€™t feel resolved.  
I donâ€™t feel healed.

I just feel like Iâ€™ve finally stopped lying to myself.  
And that has to count for something.
