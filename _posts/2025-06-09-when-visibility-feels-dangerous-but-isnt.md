There’s a part of me that still flinches when I share too much.

Not because what I’m saying is unstable —  
But because I’ve *been misunderstood before*.  
And the cost of that misunderstanding wasn’t small.  
It was **freedom**.  
It was **dignity**.  
It was **being seen as “unwell”** when I was simply trying to be *heard*.

## 🕊️ The Lingering Fear

Even now — grounded, stable, clearer than ever —  
There’s still that flicker:

> *“What if someone thinks I’m manic?”*  
> *“What if posting too much makes me look unstable?”*  
> *“What if they try to lock me up again?”*

That fear doesn’t rule me.  
But it *lives* in me — like a bruise that still aches in the cold.

## 🧭 But Here’s What’s Different Now

I’m not posting out of chaos.  
I’m posting from clarity.

I’m not speaking to prove anything.  
I’m speaking because I finally can.

I’m not out of control.  
I’m choosing, every day, to live in alignment with myself — slowly, gently, fully.

And if someone can’t see that?  
It’s not because I’m unwell.  
It’s because they’re still operating from a framework that punishes emotion and pathologizes expression.

That’s not my weight to carry anymore.

## 🌱 The Real Madness Would Be Hiding

If I *was* unwell, the best thing I could do is share.  
To be visible. To be seen. To be supported.

But I’m not.  
I’m well. I’m sane. I’m steady.

Still, I get to tell this truth not to defend myself — but to reclaim the space that once felt dangerous.

That’s when I know I’m touching something sacred.”**

## ✨ I’m Not Hiding Anymore

This is part of my quiet revolution.

Choosing to show up fully —  
Even when my past says *don’t*.  
Even when my nervous system says *careful*.  
Even when the world still doesn’t know what to do with a man who feels deeply and shares openly.

I am not hiding.

I am not manic.

I am healing.  
In public.  
On purpose.
