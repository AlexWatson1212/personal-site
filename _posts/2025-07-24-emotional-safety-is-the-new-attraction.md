I used to think attraction was a feeling in my chest — that electric spark, the intensity, the chasing. But now, I’m realising that what actually draws me in — *what makes me want to stay* — is something much quieter.

**Emotional safety.**

It’s the way someone looks at you and doesn’t want to own you or fix you.  
It’s when you speak and they don’t flinch or change the subject.  
It’s when your nervous system exhales around them without needing permission.

That’s what feels magnetic now.  
Not the adrenaline. Not the mystery.  
But the peace.

I’ve spent so much of my life around people who activated my anxiety. Who made me feel like I had to chase, decode, or earn their love. But these days, I find myself softening in the presence of people who don’t demand anything from me. People who don’t punish silence. People who don’t make connection feel like a test.

That’s not boring. That’s **secure**.

And sure — emotional safety doesn’t mean someone is perfect. It doesn’t mean they never make mistakes. But it means they **take responsibility**. It means they know the weight of their words. It means they have enough awareness not to project their pain all over you when life gets hard.

I’ve come to realise:  
I’m no longer attracted to people I have to explain basic empathy to.  
I’m no longer flattered by being tolerated.  
I’m no longer chasing connection through chaos.

What I want now is *peace with depth*.  
Warmth with accountability.  
Love that doesn’t require me to bleed to prove it’s real.

**Emotional safety is the new attraction.**  
And I won’t settle for anything less.
