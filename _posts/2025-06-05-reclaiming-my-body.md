Today I did something I’ve never done before.  
I touched myself—not to escape, not to fantasise, not to numb—but to *connect*.  
And for the first time, I stayed fully present through all of it.

I touched the parts of myself that made me feel *wanted*—by *me*.  
Not for anyone else’s gaze. Not to prove anything. Just because… I’m allowed to.

And it was surreal.  
Not because it was wild or intense, but because it was **real**.  

I’ve spent so many years disconnected from my body.  
Even when I was in great shape, I never let myself *see* my own beauty.  
Never appreciated how good it feels to be in my skin, as I am.  
To say *out loud*, even now:  
**I have a beautiful body. I’m a beautiful human. I’m sexual. I’m primal. I’m sensual.**

And saying that still feels strange—but it also feels *freeing*.

I’m not trying to master my sexuality. I’m just meeting it.  
And honestly? I like who I’m meeting.

What’s scarier is the thought of *sharing* that with someone one day.  
Letting them know that I’m still discovering this part of me.  
That I’ve never really explored my sensuality with another person.  
That I’m a bit naive in that way—but also open, curious, excited.

And maybe that’s what real intimacy looks like:  
Not being polished, but being *present*.  
Not knowing everything, but *wanting to discover it together*.  

This moment wasn’t about climax.  
It was about **not abandoning myself**.  
And I didn’t.

For the first time, I felt what it means to be *with myself*—completely.
