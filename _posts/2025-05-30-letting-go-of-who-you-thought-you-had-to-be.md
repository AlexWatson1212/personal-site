For so long, I tried to be the person I thought I was supposed to be.

The one who had it together. The one who didn’t rock the boat. The one who always smiled, always coped, always held it all in.

That version of me was shaped by survival. By what the world rewarded. By what I thought would keep me safe.

But something started to crack.

Not in a loud, dramatic way — more like a quiet, persistent ache. A sense that I was wearing a version of myself that no longer fit. That maybe never did.

It’s grieving the version of yourself that kept you alive — while making space for the one that can help you truly live.

And it’s messy.

You might not know who you are without the mask. You might feel lost, exposed, unsure of where to place your feet. That’s okay.

Because what you’re doing is brave.

You’re rewriting the rules. Redefining strength. Giving yourself permission to soften where you used to brace.

You’re learning that your worth isn’t in how well you perform. It’s in how honestly you live.

So take a breath. Let the layers fall. You don’t need to be everything for everyone anymore.

**You’re allowed to become who you really are — even if it means letting go of who they taught you to be.**
