Sometimes it hits me like a wave — the raw truth of it all:

My life has been so fucking lonely.

So lonely, in fact, that a part of me doesn’t believe it could have really been *that* bad.  
That inner voice creeps in and says:  
> *“Surely you’re exaggerating.”*  
> *“Other people had it worse.”*  
> *“You’re just being dramatic.”*

But that’s not truth.  
That’s my inner critic — trained by a childhood where my reality was dismissed or denied.  
That’s the voice I built to survive a world that didn’t see me.

Because if I admitted how bad it actually was…  
If I let the full weight of that loneliness land…  
I don’t know if I could’ve coped.

So I gaslit myself.  
Minimised.  
Tried to make it sound manageable.  
Tried to believe that maybe it was just *me* — too sensitive, too needy, too emotional.

But I wasn’t.

I was just a child who needed love, and didn’t get it.  
A teenager who needed connection, and was left alone.  
A young adult who accepted breadcrumbs because I thought that was all I was worth.  
And now, as a man, I’m finally letting it in.

The truth is:  
It *was* that bad.  
It *was* that lonely.  
And just because I survived it with a smile on my face, doesn’t mean it didn’t leave damage behind.

I think the reason I’m so tired lately — so exhausted at a level sleep can’t fix — is because I’m finally processing the emotional weight of a life lived in isolation.

And when I get small glimpses of what it’s like to feel seen — in therapy, in counselling training — my body realises just how much it’s missed.  
And the grief floods in.

Not because I’m broken.  
But because I’m healing.

So when that voice says, *“Could it really have been that bad?”*  
I’m learning to say back:  
> *“Yes. And it’s okay to feel how much it hurt.”*

Because I won’t abandon myself anymore — not to make other people comfortable, and not to protect an old story that never served me.

This was my life.  
And now, finally, I get to live the next part differently.
