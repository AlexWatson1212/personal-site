description: The things I long for aren’t flaws — they’re the compass pointing me back to my unmet needs. And when I stop shaming them, I start coming home to myself.

There was a time I used to hide my longings.  
Like they were weaknesses.  
Proof I wasn’t evolved enough.  
Like needing anything made me unworthy of having it.

But now I see it differently.  
My longings — the quiet ache, the dreams that return when I least expect — they aren’t indulgent.  
They’re *clues*.  
Messages from the parts of me still waiting to be met.

> A loving partner.  
> To be loved and appreciated.  
> A career that holds both purpose and provision.  
> To make enough to care for myself, my son, and still have something to give back.  
> Justice. Fairness.  
> Growth. Fulfilment.  
> Something bigger than me. Something lasting.

These aren’t just hopes.  
They’re expressions of *valid needs*.  
For connection.  
For meaning.  
For contribution.  
For love — not the surface kind, but the kind that sees you *all the way through*.

---

And maybe the most important shift is this:

> I’ve stopped seeing my longings as evidence that something’s wrong with me.  
> I’ve started seeing them as evidence that something’s *right*.

Because if I didn’t long for more, I would’ve given up a long time ago.  
And I didn’t.  
I still haven’t.

And that says something.

I think many of us have learned to mute these inner signals.  
To settle.  
To shrink.  
To wear “gratitude” like a muzzle when the soul is crying out for something more honest, more real, more *true*.

But I want to honour them now.  
The quiet prayers.  
The deep hunger.  
The part of me that believes life *can* be rich and whole and sacred — not just bearable.

---

So I’m listening.

Not chasing. Not forcing.

But listening —  
to what my longings reveal  
about the life I’m ready to live.

And that…  
feels like coming home.
