There’s a group chat I’m in.  
It’s full of kind people. Safe people. People who, in many ways, I trust.  
And yet… I still can’t bring myself to check it all the time.

There’s nothing wrong with the group.  
But I’m learning something about **myself** — about how I need to pace this stage of healing.

### I’m Noticing I Don’t Need to Check In Every Five Minutes

Not because I don’t care.  
Not because I’m disconnected.  
But because **constant checking has always been a way to soothe fear** — the fear of missing something, of being left behind, of being unworthy if I’m not available.

But now?

> *I’m starting to choose peace over hypervigilance.*  
> *Presence over performance.*

I don’t need to stay wired in just to feel safe.  
I can check once a day.  
I can wait until my body feels ready.  
And that’s not avoidance. That’s **trust** — in myself, in the people who are there, and in the pace that keeps me well.

### Stress Doesn’t Equal Safety

Yesterday, my stress levels were through the roof.  
All day. Through the night.  
Even though nothing overtly dangerous happened — it was just my nervous system working overtime.

It reminded me that just because something is good for me **in theory**, it doesn’t mean I’m ready to be immersed in it fully.  
Even safe connection can feel intense when I’ve lived a life that taught me to be cautious with closeness.

### Tiny Teaspoons of Trust

That’s what I’m doing.

Not pouring the whole bottle of vulnerability at once.  
Not rushing toward some perfect version of community.  
Just offering myself **tiny teaspoons** of trust.

One reply. One check-in. One message. One silence.

And when it feels right — another.

### It’s All Coming Together in Its Own Way

Maybe it’s not about fixing the whole system.  
Maybe it’s just about **slowing down enough to let it rewire safely**.

I don’t need to force connection.  
I don’t need to rush safety.  
I don’t need to prove anything.

> I just need to keep choosing myself — gently, daily — and let the rest come when it’s ready.

And maybe that’s what healing really is:  
Not an explosion. Not a moment.

Just a quiet series of **tiny teaspoons**.
