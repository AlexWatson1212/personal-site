There are 48 places for Level 4.  
Around 70 people have applied.  
That means 22 won’t get in.

I could be one of them. But I don’t think I will be.

Not out of arrogance—out of clarity.  
I know who I am now. I know what I bring.  
And I know, with just as much steadiness, that I’ve been wrong before.  
I could be wrong again.

But even if I was—if I didn’t make it—I’d be okay.  
I’d take a year out. Reflect. Ask for feedback. Integrate what I learn.  
That wouldn’t be failure. It would be a reorientation.

### The Selection Process Feels… Foggy

Some are getting online interviews.  
Some are being invited in.  
Some haven’t heard a word.

It’s disorienting.  
There doesn’t seem to be a pattern that makes sense from the outside.

But I do know this:  
I was invited in *in person*—early, in fact. Maybe even the first.

Was that because they had a question about me? Maybe.  
Was it because they needed clarity, to really *see* me again? Possibly.  
Was it because they cared enough to want that clarity? Definitely.

### A Quiet Trust in My Path

One of the tutors who interviewed me knows me well.  
There’s history there. Depth. Some projection, maybe, but also mutual recognition.  
I think they *see* me. Even if there’s uncertainty, I believe there’s also trust.

And here's the other truth:

I’ve shown up.  
I’ve done the work.  
I’ve reflected with honesty.  
I’ve missed just one session in an entire year, while others missed several.  
Yes, I’ve been late a few times—but I’ve been present.  
In every sense of the word.

Given the circumstances of my life right now, I’ve done everything within my power to get here.

So if I don’t get through to Level 4, it won’t be because I held back.  
It won’t be because I didn’t care.  
It won’t be because I didn’t *show up*.

And that brings me peace.  
Because sometimes the most honest thing you can say is:  
**I did my best. And I’m proud of it.**
