When I didn’t trust myself, it always showed up the same way:

A **slump in energy**.  
A sense that I was being *penalised*.  
The old coping mechanisms I’d worked so hard to outgrow suddenly felt more appealing again.

Every time I ignored that deeper voice—the one I now think of as my soul—I ended up feeling drained, scattered, or stuck in some kind of paralysis. I’d analyse decisions to death. Think them through every possible angle. And yet I’d feel *less* clear by the end of it, not more.

I was brought up in a world that praised logic, analysis, and criticism. What I authentically wanted never really mattered. The part of me that *felt* truth—that moved by intuition—was never encouraged. It wasn’t even acknowledged.

So I didn’t give it any credit.

But something’s changed.

I’ve started to **cultivate that part of me**—the intuitive, soul-guided part—and I’ve begun giving it *precedence* over the purely intellectual side. Not because logic is bad (I still value that part of me deeply), but because I’ve seen time and time again that:

> **My intuition is wiser, faster, and far more energy-efficient.**

I’ve learned that when I trust my gut—not in a reactive way, but in a grounded, felt sense—things unfold more smoothly. I don’t feel like I’m fighting myself. I don’t need to justify everything. I just *know* in my body what’s right, even if I don’t yet know *why*.

This doesn’t mean I make snap decisions.  
It means I *listen to the feeling first*, and let the rest of me follow.

I used to think the goal was balance—equal parts head and heart.

But now? I’m not so sure.  
Because I’ve realised that my most logical, structured, and insightful decisions actually come *from inside the feeling*, not outside it.

That’s where integration happens.  
That’s where I start to uncover who I really am—not just what’s “correct.”

I still don’t fully know the man I’m becoming.  
But I trust the process now.  
And I trust that **whatever I become**, it will be more real than anything I could have planned.

So I’m not resisting as much.

I’m not trying to get it all right.

I’m just checking in, listening closely, and letting my energy be the compass.

Because trusting your gut isn’t the opposite of being wise.  
Sometimes, it *is* the wisest thing you can do.

And I think that’s the work, really.

> Trust your soul.
