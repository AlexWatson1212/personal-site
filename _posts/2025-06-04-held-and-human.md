I want to be held.  
I want to feel safe.  
I want to be seen — not for what I can do, but for who I am.

That longing has lived in me for as long as I can remember, but I’ve often avoided it. Instead, I’ve filled it with food, porn, or moments of fleeting closeness — anything to ease the ache that I’ve been taught to feel shame about. But there’s no shame in wanting connection. There never was.

I used to think I couldn’t meet that need without someone else. But I’m starting to understand myself differently now. I *can* hold myself. I *can* ask what that part of me needs. And sometimes, it’s as simple as hugging my dog. She just *is*. She doesn’t ask me to be anyone else. She wants to be close. And honestly, my body doesn’t know the difference — in those moments, I *am* held.

Still, I’d love to be held by a human being. Not just sexually — though I’m not ashamed of wanting that too — but emotionally, deeply. I want to be seen, accepted, and met. And I realise now that I was getting some of that at college, especially on Wednesdays. Those days gave me emotional nourishment, moments of real connection. Now that college has ended, I feel the gap.

I see it now — that’s why the girl from college meant something to me. I felt emotionally safe with her, at least in glimpses. That’s also why I felt what I thought was attraction to my therapist. She *saw* me. She didn’t need me to perform. It might not have been romantic — maybe it was just my nervous system responding to being seen and accepted for the first time in a long time.

The same thing happened with Dave from college. He genuinely saw me — not for what I could do, but for who I was. And in a world where I’ve often been reduced to my usefulness, that meant everything.

I’ve spent a lot of time choosing people who weren’t ready to meet me in that place. People who couldn’t hold what I was longing for. And then I’d feel disappointed — sometimes devastated. But I’m trusting the process more now. I’m learning to stop chasing and start listening.

I *know* I can meet someone who holds me, emotionally and physically. My attraction to women has never been the issue — it’s the emotional safety that matters. And it may not come in the package I expect, but I’m open to that now. Maybe that’s a good thing.

I’ll probably still slip up sometimes — maybe reach for porn again. But I’m noticing that it’s happening less and less. And what’s come in its place? Energy. Creativity. A sense of possibility.

That’s the shift I want to honour today.

I’m learning to hold myself — and in doing so, I’m making room to be held by someone else, when the time is right.

And that… that feels like a quiet revolution.
