Date: 2025-06-24

Description: Chapter 18 of *Living an Examined Life* explores how our parents live on inside us — not just in memory, but in the unconscious voices that shape our choices. Healing begins when we recognise them, and choose differently.
Emotions: [grief, acceptance]

Some voices don’t belong to us — but we live by them anyway.

In Chapter 18 of *Living an Examined Life*, James Hollis explores the idea that our parents continue to live inside us long after childhood. Not in memory alone — but in the **internalised voices** that direct our fears, our shame, our self-worth, and our boundaries.

> “Unless we examine and challenge the parental voices within, we are living someone else’s life.”  
> — James Hollis

That hit hard.

Because I’ve already set boundaries with my actual parents.  
But it’s the **residue** that lingers.  
- The self-doubt.  
- The instinct to freeze when someone’s disappointed in me.  
- The guilt that creeps in when I rest or say no.  

These aren’t just habits.  
They’re echoes of an early environment that taught me who I had to be in order to be safe, seen, or spared.

And even now — with all the awareness I’ve cultivated — that old conditioning can still run the show if I don’t slow down and name it.

This chapter isn’t about blaming our parents.  
It’s about reclaiming authority over the voices we listen to.

And learning to speak with a **new voice**:
- One rooted in present truth, not past survival.
- One that doesn’t shrink to please or silence to stay safe.
- One that knows how to self-parent — kindly, firmly, honestly.

I don’t want to live a life authored by ghosts.  
I want to raise my son — and myself — in a story I’ve *consciously chosen*.

That begins with recognising which voices are still speaking…  
and whether I still believe them.
