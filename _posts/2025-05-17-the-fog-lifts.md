I realized recently why my mother got so upset when I used Google Maps instead of listening to her.

It wasn’t about directions. It was about **control** — and the fear of losing it.

Google Maps represented something deeper: that her sense of being “the one who knows” was no longer needed. That she was becoming *irrelevant*. And that’s terrifying when your identity has been built on certainty, on always being right, on leading without ever questioning yourself.

She wasn’t just angry at a piece of technology — she was scared.  
Because I didn’t need her to guide me anymore.  
And if I didn’t need her knowledge, maybe I didn’t need her at all.

What I used to interpret as confidence or wisdom…  
I now see for what it really was: **arrogance dressed up as authority**, driven by a fear of being left behind.

The fog lifts with space.  
And with it comes grief — not just for the childhood I didn’t have, but for the connection that was never safe enough to trust.  
But it also brings freedom.

Because now I see clearly.  
And I can choose a different path.
