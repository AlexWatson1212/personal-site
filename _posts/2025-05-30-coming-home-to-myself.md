For most of my life, I thought healing meant *becoming better* — more confident, more successful, more in control.

But the more I chased “better,” the more disconnected I felt.

I was always reaching for a version of myself that felt just out of reach — one who had finally “arrived,” finally felt worthy, finally made sense to everyone around me.

Until I paused long enough to ask:

> What if healing isn’t about chasing some perfect version of myself?  
> What if it’s about *coming home* to the one I already am?

The one beneath the masks.  
The one I tucked away to survive.  
The one who feels deeply, even when it’s inconvenient.

Coming home to myself has looked like:  
- Saying no without guilt.  
- Crying without apology.  
- Laughing too loud.  
- Needing people, and letting them know.  
- Listening to the soft parts I used to silence.

It hasn’t been tidy. It hasn’t been linear. But it’s been real.

And maybe that’s what makes it feel like home — not that it’s perfect, but that it’s *mine*.

The world will always try to convince us to perform — to become more palatable, more productive, more “together.”  
But the real journey is returning to who we were before we learned to perform at all.

**I’m not chasing anymore. I’m remembering. And I’m finally home.**
