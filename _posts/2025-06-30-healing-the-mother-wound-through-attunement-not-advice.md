I didn’t go into therapy asking for a mother. But that’s what I got—just not in the way I expected.

What I came in with was the longing to heal my relationships with women. I wanted to be able to connect securely, to stop projecting old wounds, to let go of the guilt I carried around my actual mother. I thought maybe I needed tools, insight, a better understanding of attachment theory.

But what I needed… was to be *met*.

And that’s what she gave me.

---

She didn’t try to fix me.  
She didn’t offer constant advice.  
She didn’t lead with interpretation or strategy.

She just showed up. Consistently. Calmly. Honestly.

And somewhere along the way, without either of us naming it, she began to feel like a mother figure. Not in some literal sense—but energetically. Relationally. She held a space that I didn’t even know I needed. A space where I could exist without shame, soften without being manipulated, and be vulnerable without fear of being punished for it.

And that changed everything.

Because the wound wasn’t about needing more information.  
It was about needing more **attunement**.

I needed to feel:
- Seen, without being studied.  
- Heard, without being corrected.  
- Loved, without being asked to shrink.  

And she did that—not with effort, but with presence.

And perhaps the most healing part of all?  
> She helped me let go of my mother *without guilt*.

Because for the first time, I experienced what a healthy maternal presence could feel like. And that made it possible to stop chasing it in people who couldn’t offer it. To stop trying to “earn” what should have been freely given. To stop blaming myself for what I didn’t receive.

There was no big catharsis. No dramatic goodbye.  
Just a gentle shift. A quiet exhale.  
Something in me let go.

And for the first time in my life, I felt ready—*genuinely ready*—to be in a secure relationship.  
Not because I fixed myself. But because I was finally *felt*.

---

She never called herself a mother.  
But her attunement made one unnecessary.

And that was the real healing.
