Something powerful happened yesterday, and it’s only this morning — rested and more regulated — that I’ve been able to see it clearly.

I didn’t just feel socially exhausted yesterday.  
I felt *wiped out*. Fried. Like every part of me had been used up.  
And I kept wondering why — what had really happened underneath the surface?

Then it landed.

**My social battery didn’t just run out — it protected me.**

I was in two difficult emotional situations:

One person was likely feeling a lot of shame, and maybe unconsciously wanted me to soften, to soothe, to step out of my truth and comfort them. But I didn’t. I held strong. I stayed grounded in what I knew to be true for me — even if that made them uncomfortable.

Another person repeatedly mocked me — calling me a woman, over and over, until it became deeply uncomfortable. It wasn’t banter anymore. It felt violating. And in the end, I left.

That’s the real reason I was fried.  
**Because I didn’t abandon myself.**

I didn’t betray my own body’s signals. I didn’t contort into someone else’s emotional needs.  
I stood in who I was, even when it cost me comfort, connection, or approval.  

And that’s new.  
That’s *huge*.

In the past, my nervous system would’ve shut all this down. I would’ve dissociated, minimized it, told myself I was being too sensitive. I might have even shamed myself for walking away.

But not anymore.

I’m starting to notice that when I wake up rested, the truth becomes more digestible.  
I can meet it.  
I can process it.  
I can hold it without falling apart.

And that’s what adulthood is starting to mean for me:  
Not perfection. Not endless emotional stamina.  
But the capacity to hold truths that used to break me.

I don’t need to control what happens anymore. I just need to stay open to the lessons.

Because yes — the more I reveal myself, the more exposed I become.  
It *feels* more dangerous.  
But it’s through that exposure — through that edge — that I truly meet myself.

Anyone can say, *“I believe in authenticity.”*  
But then life asks: *“Do you really?”*

People test it. Consciously or not.  
They poke. They prod. They push.

And yesterday, I didn’t collapse.

**I passed the test. With flying colours.**

Not only did I leave when people were being disrespectful — or when it *felt* disrespectful to me —  
I also left with class. With courage. With presence.

I hugged everyone. I didn’t make a scene.  
I just walked out, put my sunglasses on, and went home.

And there’s a deep pride in that.  
A quiet kind of strength that comes from holding myself when no one else could.

I’m so insanely proud of how I honoured myself.

This wasn’t avoidance.  
This was alignment.

And that matters more to me than being liked, understood, or validated in the moment.

Because this is who I am now:  
Someone who walks away with grace — not guilt.
