> “The choice is not between difficulty and ease; it is between meaningful difficulty and meaningless difficulty.” — James Hollis

God, this one lands hard.

Because right now, I am tired.  
I’m lonely.  
And the temptation to want something *easier* is real.

Easier relationships.  
Easier paths.  
Easier answers.

But the truth is — I’ve *already lived the easy way*.  
The one where I said yes when I meant no.  
The one where I hid my pain to keep the peace.  
The one where I betrayed myself to avoid being alone.

That wasn’t ease. That was erosion.

So now I’m choosing something else:  
**Meaningful difficulty.**

- The difficulty of sitting with my own emotions rather than outsourcing them.  
- The difficulty of rebuilding a life from scratch — on my own terms.  
- The difficulty of walking away from what’s familiar, even when it still pulls.

It hurts. But at least it’s *mine*.

This chapter reminds me that ease is a false god.  
And that the soul doesn’t ask for comfort — it asks for truth, depth, and meaning.

And maybe that’s why it’s so hard right now.  
Because I’m doing the work that *actually matters*.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
Where in my life am I still chasing ease?  
And what would it look like to choose meaningful difficulty instead?
