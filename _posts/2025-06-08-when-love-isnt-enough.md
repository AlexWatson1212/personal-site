Just a few days ago, I felt a wave of deep love for my father.  
I remembered moments that hinted at care, at sacrifice, at something noble hidden beneath his distance.  
And I let myself feel it.

Maybe that was love.  
Maybe he did love me â€” in the only way he knew how.

But now, with space and reflection, something else has emerged:  
> *Indifference. Or maybe something quieter than that â€” clarity.*

### ðŸ§  The Inner Child Needed to Believe

For most of my life, a younger part of me *had to believe* he loved me.  
Because the alternative â€” that he pushed me away, rejected me, or simply didnâ€™t know how to be with me â€” was too painful to face.

So I protected him in my mind.  
I made his silence into strategy.  
His absence into sacrifice.  
His coldness into care.

That story helped me survive.  
But it didnâ€™t help me *heal*.

### ðŸª¨ Now I See It Differently

Now, I can say:

> *Even if he believed he loved me, I donâ€™t agree with how he showed it.*  
> *And I donâ€™t have to carry the burden of trying to make it enough.*

I get to decide what love is for me now.  
I get to say:  
- *Love isnâ€™t silence.*  
- *Love isnâ€™t abandonment.*  
- *Love isnâ€™t something that leaves a hole in your chest and calls it protection.*

### ðŸ§­ Love That Isnâ€™t Felt Isnâ€™t Love That Heals

Maybe he loved me.  
But if that love didnâ€™t hold me, protect me, nurture me, or make me feel safe â€”  
Then it wasnâ€™t the kind of love I needed.

It mightâ€™ve been love in his mind.  
But it didnâ€™t land.  
It didnâ€™t reach.  
And it didnâ€™t raise me.

And thatâ€™s not bitterness.  
Thatâ€™s *truth*.

### ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m Not Angry Anymore. Just Clear.

He doesnâ€™t get to define what love means for me anymore.  
He doesnâ€™t get to have the final word â€” because heâ€™s gone.  
And because Iâ€™m no longer the child hoping heâ€™ll come back in some better form.

> *Iâ€™m the one who defines love now.*  
> And I want a kind of love that shows up.  
> That holds.  
> That stays.  
> That doesnâ€™t confuse or control or vanish.

And if what he gave me doesnâ€™t meet that standard?  
Iâ€™m allowed to let it go.

### ðŸ•¯ What Remains

I honour the boy who wanted so badly to be loved.  
I honour the man Iâ€™ve become who now sees clearly why that love was never enough.

And I walk forward with the kind of love I needed back then â€”  
the kind I now know how to give to myself.

Soft. Present. Clear.  
Enough.
