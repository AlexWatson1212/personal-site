Sometimes I wonder if I’m taking too long.

If I should be further along. Clearer. Braver. More consistent. Less triggered. More “healed.”

But then I breathe—and remember:

**Becoming takes time.**

Real change isn’t linear.  
It happens slowly, then all at once.  
It’s found in the pauses. The setbacks. The quiet moments no one sees.

And the version of me I’m becoming?

He’s learning to rest.  
To trust himself.  
To say no with ease.  
To walk away when it hurts—even if he still loves.

She’s not rushing anymore.  
She’s growing on purpose.

And she knows that slow doesn’t mean stuck.

It means *rooted*.

I’m not behind—I’m in bloom.

Even if no one else sees it yet.
