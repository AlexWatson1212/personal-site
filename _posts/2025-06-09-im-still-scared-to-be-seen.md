I’ve made progress.  
I’ve opened up more.  
I’ve been more honest, more vulnerable, more *me* — and that’s a win.

But I’m still scared.

And not in a dramatic way — in a quiet, lingering, **nervous-system-deep** way.  
Like there’s a voice waiting behind every bold step, whispering:

> *“You’re being too much.”*  
> *“People are going to think you’re crazy.”*  
> *“You’ll bring shame on your family.”*  
> *“You’re embarrassing yourself.”*

## 🧠 Logically, I Know…

- If I never reveal myself, I’ll never be known.  
- If I keep hiding, I’ll keep feeling alone.  
- If I wait until I feel “ready,” I’ll wait forever.

But fear doesn’t live in logic.  
It lives in the **old voices** — the ones I didn’t choose but still carry.

## 👤 The Critical Voice

It’s not really me.

It’s a blend of my mother’s shaming voice, society’s discomfort with emotion, and a world that trained me to shrink.

It’s the voice of the **internalised parent**, not the one I’m becoming.

And the more I see that, the more I realise:

> **This fear isn’t mine — it was *installed*.**

And I don’t have to obey it anymore.

## 🥊 I’m Still Showing Up

Even with the fear.  
Even with the tightness in my chest.  
Even with the part of me that still flinches every time I tell the truth.

Because healing isn’t the absence of fear — it’s **not letting fear decide for me**.

And every time I post something honest,  
Every time I speak without performing,  
Every time I sit in the discomfort and stay soft instead of shutting down…

I’m proving to myself that the fear doesn’t get the final say.

## 💬 Final Thought

Maybe the fear never fully goes away.  
Maybe I’ll always have that whisper in the background.

But I’m no longer living by its rules.

I’m building a new voice — one that says:

> *“You’re not too much.  
You’re just finally letting yourself be seen.”*

And that’s enough.  
I’m enough.

Even while scared,  
I’m still showing up.
