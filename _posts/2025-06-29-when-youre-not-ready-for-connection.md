There’s a voice in me that says:

> *You need to find a partner.*  
> *You should go make new friends.*  
> *You’re too alone.*

And I hear it. I understand where it comes from — the part of me shaped by years of emotional isolation, who just wants to be held, seen, loved, understood.

But here’s the truth:

> Right now, I’m okay on my own.

More than okay — I’m *rebuilding*. Slowly, quietly, intentionally.

I’m learning to **trust myself** and this process of becoming.  
I’m doing everything I can to **recuperate energy** after a lifetime of giving too much of it away.

To be honest, I don’t have anything spare to go out searching for people — not out of fear, but because it would be **forced**. And that’s not how I want to live anymore.

## 🤍 This Isn’t Isolation. It’s Integration.

When I check in with my authentic self — the one that’s no longer performing or chasing — I feel clear:  
**I want to stay home and rest.**

And that’s not regression. That’s sacred.  
It’s the body finally feeling safe enough to be still.  
It’s the soul no longer rushing toward something to prove it’s worthy.

There will be a time when I’m ready.  
But it’s not today. And that’s okay.

If you’re in this place too — where your body says *not yet*, even when your mind says *go* — trust the body.

The world will still be there when you're ready.  
But right now, your presence with yourself is the most important relationship of all.
