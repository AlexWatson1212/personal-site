description: After a lifetime of being destabilised, dismissed, or gaslit, I’ve finally stepped into quiet emotional power. It doesn’t mean I’ll hurt anyone. It just means I won’t be hurt so easily anymore.

For most of my life, I’ve felt emotionally powerless around my mother.

Not just small, but unstable — like the ground beneath me could shift at any moment. I never knew how she’d respond. I’d try to express pain or set a boundary, and somehow I’d end up feeling like the villain. It was like being emotionally cross-examined, with no exit, no witness, and no place to land.

Recently, I sent her a message. A clear one.  
I didn’t shout. I didn’t beg. I didn’t accuse.  
I simply told the truth: that I can’t keep her in my life in the same way, and that real change — not performance — would be needed if any relationship were to continue.

Twelve hours later, she replied.  
She said she’s reflected.  
She said she’s open to therapy — but only if we do it *together*.  
She said she’s always loved me and wants to have a continuing relationship with me and my son.

And I didn’t feel joy.  
I didn’t feel relief.  
I felt my body light up — my nervous system going into fight-or-flight before I even finished the first line.

Because I know this pattern.  
This wasn’t true accountability.  
This was image management.  
This was a way to offer something — *but on her terms*, and without facing herself.

For the first time in my life, though, I didn’t spiral.  
I didn’t collapse.  
I didn’t start writing a long reply trying to explain why her message still didn’t feel right.

Instead, I noticed the game.  
And I stayed still.

What I’ve realised is that she’s trying to *regain a little control* — which makes sense. She’s never been in this position before. I’ve always come back. I’ve always softened. I’ve always taken the blame.

But not now.  
Now, I don’t need her to admit everything.  
I don’t even need her to change.

I just need to stay in my truth.

And yes — part of me feels strange even considering keeping some form of relationship open. Because there’s a financial inheritance there, and I don’t want to feel like I’m staying in contact *just* for that. But the truth is more complex than that.

The truth is:
- I don’t *need* her anymore.
- I don’t *hate* her either.
- I’m simply not abandoning myself to stay connected.
- And if one day, there’s something left financially, I won’t feel like I sold my soul. I’ll know I protected my peace and navigated this with clarity.

---

I’ve accepted that she’ll never be the mother I needed.  
That’s not bitterness — it’s grief, metabolised.  
What I hope for now isn’t repair. It’s neutrality.  
A version of low-contact that protects me, protects my son, and holds firm to the boundaries I’ve earned.

### Here Are My Quiet Conditions:

- I won’t attend therapy *with her* unless it’s to support her first step into her own journey — not to be fixed together.  
- I won’t abandon what I’ve seen, just because her tone is softer.  
- I won’t get pulled into manipulation wrapped in affection.  
- I won’t offer access to Victor unless I feel *genuinely safe and respected as his parent*.  
- I won’t justify, explain, or collapse to maintain appearances.

And most importantly:

- I won’t shrink again.  
Not for her. Not for anyone.

It feels strange — and a little sad — to have this power now.  
Not because I want to hurt her.  
But because I’m no longer willing to be hurt **to keep the peace**.

I don’t need to fight.  
I don’t need to fix.  
I don’t even need to respond yet.

I just need to stay in my seat.

And I will.
