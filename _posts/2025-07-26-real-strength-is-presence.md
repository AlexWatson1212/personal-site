For most of my life, I think I misunderstood what strength really meant.

I thought it was about being unshakeable, unfazed, in control.  
I thought it had something to do with dominance, or maybe even stoicism.  
But I’m realising now—**real strength is presence**.

Not just being “in the room,” but actually being *here*. With myself. With others. With what is.

## What Presence Requires

Presence isn’t a passive thing. It’s not just sitting still or not reacting.  
It’s **deep, grounded, layered work**. It means:

- **Emotional regulation** – the ability to stay with discomfort without numbing, fleeing, or exploding.
- **Empathy** – the capacity to attune to another’s emotional world without becoming overwhelmed by it.
- **Openness** – not rushing to judge or fix, but allowing reality to unfold and be witnessed.
- **Accountability** – owning how I show up in a space, even when I’m uncomfortable or triggered.
- **Responsibility** – acting in alignment with my values, even when it would be easier not to.

And that last one’s important.

Because the more present I am, the more conscious I become of the **gap between reaction and response**. And that’s where real power lives.

## Presence Isn’t Gendered

At first, I felt like I was naming something “masculine”—responsibility, regulation, stillness.

But I know now: **presence is not a gendered quality.**

It draws from both:
- The masculine stillness, clarity, and containment.
- The feminine receptivity, attunement, and openness.

It’s not about strength *as performance*. It’s about strength *as rootedness*.

## The Evidence Is in How I Now Choose to Respond

- When someone tries to intimidate me, I don’t escalate or submit. I just step back. Or I say something disarming. Or I leave.
- When people lie, deny, or rewrite reality, I don’t argue. I just let them be wrong.
- When I’m triggered, I try to pause and check what part of me is activated, rather than letting it drive the car.

I don’t fight people anymore.  
I don’t need to prove myself.

I just stay present—**with what I know, with what I feel, and with what matters.**

## This Kind of Strength Is Rare

It’s not celebrated.  
It’s not loud.  
It’s not always even noticed.

But it changes everything.

Because the more time I spend in presence, the less time I spend trying to escape.  
And when I’m not escaping, I can live in alignment. I can act with clarity. I can respond with compassion.  
And I can return to myself, again and again.

This is the kind of strength I want to build my life on.

Not the kind that dominates.

The kind that stays.
