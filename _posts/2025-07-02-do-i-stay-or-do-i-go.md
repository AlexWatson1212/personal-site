Sometimes the question isn’t about what’s objectively right — it’s about what’s **right for now**.

Lately, I’ve been asking myself: *Do I really want to live here long term?*

My home is mine.  
I’ve poured energy into making it feel safe, more like me.  
But outside those walls — on this street — there are people I’ve had to set strong boundaries with. People I can no longer speak to. And I have to walk past them nearly every day.

## The Daily Tension

There’s a tension in that.  
Not fear, exactly — but discomfort.  
A constant low hum in the background.

These aren’t just strangers. They’re people who’ve shown disrespect.  
Maybe it came from something I triggered in them. Maybe my distance activated their own insecurities. But I don’t think it’s my job to psychoanalyze everyone who mistreats me.

I didn’t ask to play that role.  
I just want peace.

## The Emotional Math

Moving feels drastic.  
Expensive. Disruptive.  
And — if I’m honest — like they might “win” if I left.

But staying also costs something.  
That quiet draining feeling of being on edge. Of looking away. Of wondering whether a polite nod might trigger something again.

I don’t want to live like that forever.  
But maybe… *not forever* doesn’t mean *not now*.

## Rooted, For Now

Right now, this place is still mine.  
It’s stable.  
It’s familiar.  
It’s a foundation I’ve worked hard to build.

And while I don’t owe anyone small talk or neighbourly connection, I do owe myself the right to live without shame. To walk down the street with quiet dignity.  
Even if that means ignoring.  
Even if that means holding a boundary with grace.

I can stay — for now.  
I don’t have to decide forever.  
But I do get to choose based on **what supports my nervous system today**.

## Closing Thought

Sometimes staying put *isn’t* giving up — it’s reclaiming your space on your own terms.  
And sometimes leaving *isn’t* losing — it’s choosing freedom.

Both are valid.  
The key is knowing *when* each is right.

And today, I think I’ll stay.
