For a long time, chaos felt like home.

Not because I liked it, but because it was *familiar*. The emotional whiplash, the unpredictability, the tension you could cut with a knife — that was what love looked like to my younger self. Not because it was love, but because that’s what I grew up around.

So I chased relationships that matched that internal wiring.  
I called it chemistry.  
I called it attraction.  
But underneath it all was a nervous system still scanning for danger and calling it connection.

Only through therapy — and a lot of painful trial and error — did I start to realise that what felt “boring” at first was actually **safe**. That people who didn’t push my buttons, who didn’t need me to prove anything, who didn’t play emotional chess… were offering me something my body didn’t know how to trust yet:

Peace.

Calm.  
Steadiness.  
Emotional responsibility.

I recently found myself feeling unexpectedly drawn to a classmate — not because she activated me, but because she **didn’t**. I felt safe around her. I looked forward to seeing her. My body felt relaxed. For once, I wasn’t waiting for the rug to be pulled from under me. I wasn’t scanning for signs she might turn.

And when she wasn’t around anymore, I missed her — not in a desperate, longing way, but in a way that helped me realise how rare and important emotional safety truly is.

That experience helped me rewire something foundational.  
It showed me that I *can* feel drawn to people who don’t create chaos.  
That attraction can be soft, grounded, nourishing — not just adrenaline and anxiety.

I’ve also recognised the ways I still sometimes lean toward the avoidant types — the ones who keep a little distance, just enough to activate the old reflex of trying to earn closeness. But now, I can see that too. And I’m not shaming myself for it. I’m learning.

This process — of moving from chaos to calm — is slow. It’s confusing at times.  
But it’s also beautiful.

Because what once felt like home no longer does.  
And what once felt foreign — peace, softness, reliability — is starting to feel familiar.  
That’s how I know I’m healing.

And I’m beginning to believe that the right people — the ones who feel like *home* in this new way — will find me when I stop abandoning myself to chase the old ones.
