It’s wild how much has surfaced in the last few days.  
Blog after blog, reflection after reflection—  
not because I’m trying to produce something,  
but because I finally have the space for all these parts of my soul to come forward and integrate.

And what’s emerging is a version of me I really like being.  
Present. Grounded. Kind. Clear.

Yesterday I met with a new young person I’m supporting through Barnardo’s.  
People had warned me he might not open the door.  
That he might disappear after five minutes.  
That he’s “difficult.”

But none of that happened.

We sat together for nearly 45 minutes.  
Just chatting.  
Nothing profound, nothing forced.  
Just the two of us, the dog, and some shared space.

And it was enough.

I wasn’t trying to extract anything from the moment.  
I wasn’t performing.  
I just met him where he was—and trusted that was enough.

That’s what all this inner work has given me:  
The ability to walk into spaces with less anxiety.  
To lead with presence instead of performance.  
To trust that if I’m attuned, if I’m clear in my intention,  
the outcome will most likely take care of itself.

Because the healing is no longer just inside me.  
It’s starting to ripple out—  
in eye contact, in gentleness, in silence, in a quiet 45 minutes that might have meant more than it seemed.

And that’s something I’m proud of.
