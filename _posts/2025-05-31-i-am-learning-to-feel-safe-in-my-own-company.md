There was a time I filled every silence.

Music. Messages. Movement.  
Anything to avoid sitting alone with myself.

Not because I didn’t like being alone —  
But because I didn’t yet feel *safe* there.

Now, that’s changing.

**I’m learning to feel safe in my own company.**

To sit on the sofa with a cup of tea and just… be.  
To walk slowly, without headphones, and listen to my thoughts.  
To enjoy my own presence without needing an audience, a distraction, or a plan.

It doesn’t mean I don’t want connection.  
It just means I don’t need it to feel okay.

Because I’m building a relationship with the one person I’ll spend every moment of my life with — myself.

And the more I listen, the more I like who I’m becoming.

Alone doesn’t feel empty anymore.

It feels like home.
