I’ve seen multiple examples of people who couldn’t love me the way I needed. And none — *not one* — of someone who could.  

Maybe that’s because I didn’t have the capacity to love in that way either. But I think I do now.  

Still, the belief that I could find someone who can meet me… that belief isn’t quite there. Not fully. There’s fear.  
Fear of getting older.  
Fear of it never happening.  
Fear that I’ll always be *too much* in some way — or not enough in others.

I’m nearly 35. That’s still young. If I wanted another family, I probably could. But honestly… I don’t think I do. It’s been *hard*. Really hard.  

What I do want is peace. And if someone comes into my life who adds to that — not subtracts from it — I’ll meet them with honesty, openness, and presence.

But I won’t contort myself anymore. I won’t settle for a relationship that stunts me emotionally. I did that once. I stayed too long.  
And it would’ve been terrible for my son.  

So maybe this is just a journal entry.  
Maybe no one reads it.  
But it’s a marker.  
That I’ve grown.  
That I’m still afraid — but I’m no longer lost in the fog.

And maybe, just maybe, that’s enough for now.
