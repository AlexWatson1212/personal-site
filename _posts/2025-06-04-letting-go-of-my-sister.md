I’m starting to realise something I didn’t want to face.

My sister doesn’t reject me because she’s unsure.  
She rejects me because she’s already decided who I am — based on what our mother told her.

And I don’t know exactly what’s been said over the years, but I can imagine it:  
Skewed stories. Convenient half-truths. Quiet drip-feeds of poison masked as concern.

I can see now that she believes those stories.  
That’s probably why we’ve never had a real relationship.  
Why she’s always kept her distance.  
Why there’s always been this coldness I couldn’t thaw, no matter how many times I tried.

And I tried.  
I stayed open. I kept showing up.  
I believed we could build something if I just stayed soft, forgiving, empathetic.

But each attempt was another **abandonment of myself**.

The hardest part?  
I understand her.  
I see her pain. I see why she might cling to the illusion.  
Because accepting the truth about our mother would unravel **everything**.

But my empathy has kept me suffering.  
Because I’ve always seen their pain more clearly than they ever saw mine.

And the truth is, she and my mother together have probably been the most selfish, emotionally destructive people I’ve ever known.  
Not because they were evil.  
But because they were **deeply unconscious** — and unwilling to wake up.

I’ve mourned the relationship I never had with my sister.  
And I’m done mourning it.

I’m not angry. I’m just… finished.

I understand why they are the way they are.  
But I **no longer accept it** in my life.

I can’t keep hoping.  
I can’t keep reaching.  
I can’t keep setting myself on fire to prove I’m warm.

The door is closed now.  
And I’m not looking back.

Because I’ve finally chosen me.
