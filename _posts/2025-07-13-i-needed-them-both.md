I think I needed them both.

The nurturing energy of my therapist, and the confronting clarity of a mentor. Not to rescue me, but to reflect me back to myself at the moment I was finally ready to see the truth.

For a long time, I couldn’t face how much I had been holding myself back. How much I’d pushed people away under the guise of helping. How tightly I clung to the role of fixer—not out of superiority, but to protect a fragile sense of worth. I needed to believe I was good. I needed to believe I was lovable. And so I helped. And helped. And helped. Until I couldn’t tell the difference between love and strategy.

And then came the realization.  
And with it, shame.  
So much shame.

And that’s why I needed her—the therapist.  
Not for more insight. Not for tools.  
But for her presence. Her calm. Her quiet maternal energy that told me, without saying it outright,  
*"Even now, you are worthy of love."*

Without that, I think I might have turned on myself. I think I might have tried to fix the part of me that had been fixing all along. But instead, I softened. I stayed. I allowed myself to see the pattern—not as a flaw, but as a child’s attempt at survival.

And then came him—the mentor.  
Not gentle. Not warm. But precise.  
Like a father saying, *“That’s enough.”*  
Not out of cruelty, but out of clarity.  
A call back to truth. A refusal to let me hide behind language or insight or unconscious performance.

Between the two of them, I received something I never had growing up: a container.

One held me.  
One challenged me.  
And between those two poles, I found myself.

It wasn’t one or the other. It was *both*.

The truth, and the tenderness.  
The mirror, and the lap to collapse into after.

And now, I’m standing in something I never thought I’d feel:  
**Self-acceptance that doesn’t need to be earned.**

I no longer need to hate the parts of me that held on to outdated strategies. I can see why I clung to them. I can forgive myself for not seeing it sooner. And I can choose differently now—not out of self-rejection, but out of self-trust.

I needed them both.

Not forever.  
But for this moment.

So I could become someone who no longer needs saving—  
just someone who’s finally here.
