I used to treat rest like it was something I had to earn.

Finish the to-do list. Push through. Stay productive.  
Then, *maybe*, I could take a break—if there was time.

But that mindset was never sustainable.  
It left me exhausted, resentful, and disconnected from my own body.

Now I know better:

**Rest isn’t something I earn. It’s something I deserve.**

Even when I’ve done “nothing.”  
Even when the dishes aren’t done.  
Even when my inner critic whispers, *“you don’t deserve to slow down yet.”*

I rest because I’m human.  
Because I’m allowed to have limits.  
Because my nervous system matters more than the appearance of productivity.

And I don’t have to wait until I’ve run myself into the ground to give myself what I need.

Rest isn’t laziness.

It’s wisdom.

It’s respect.

And it’s how I show up better—*for me* and for everyone around me.
