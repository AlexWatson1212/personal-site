There was a time I thought I had to wait.

Wait until I healed more.  
Wait until I felt better.  
Wait until I didn’t mess up, fall short, or feel broken.

Only then could I offer myself kindness.  
Only then did I think I was worthy of love.

But I see it differently now.

**I’m learning to love myself *through* it — not just after it.**

Through the doubts.  
Through the messy bits.  
Through the parts I’m still working on.

Self-love doesn’t mean always liking what I see.  
It means I stay with myself even when I don’t.  
It means I offer grace where I used to give guilt.  
It means I treat myself like someone I care about — especially when I’m hurting.

I don’t need to be perfect to be worthy of love.

I never did.

So I show up now — with gentleness.

Because healing doesn’t require harshness.

It requires *holding*.
