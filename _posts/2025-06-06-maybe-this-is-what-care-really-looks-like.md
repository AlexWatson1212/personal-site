description: I’ve spent years projecting mistrust onto women who cared for me. Today, I saw someone clearly — and, for the first time, let her care land.

I feel alive within me today.

Not because everything is perfect.  
Not because the pain is gone.  
But because I’ve accepted the parts of me I used to reject —  
especially the part that struggles to trust women who care.

For a long time, I projected my past onto present moments.  
Onto women in positions of power.  
Onto people who showed care I couldn’t quite believe in.  
It’s not that I didn’t want to trust — it’s that I didn’t *know* how to receive something that wasn’t attached to control.

But today, something shifted.

In our session, my tutor asked how I was doing.  
She asked me in front of the group — and I felt a wave of something rise.  
I responded honestly:  
> “The thing that comes to mind… I don’t want to share in front of a group of people.”

And I think she knew.  
Not just that I was holding something heavy,  
but that I needed someone to see me — *gently*, without force.

And that’s exactly what she did.

---

She didn’t rush in to fix it.  
She didn’t make a scene.  
But she stayed emotionally attuned — even through the structure of a tutor-student dynamic.

I think she knew it might trigger something in me.  
And I think she *chose* to risk that discomfort — not to provoke me,  
but to offer a mirror, to help me see where my wounds still live.

And she did it knowing that, whatever came up, she could hold it.  
> That… might be the deepest form of care I’ve ever received.

---

She wears a strong exterior.  
Sometimes sharp. Sometimes closed.  
But today, I saw the little girl in her — the one who still looks out for people.  
I saw the strength she had to become,  
and the softness she’s never fully let go of.

I respect her deeply.  
And more than that — I appreciate her.

---

This didn’t erase my wounds.  
But it softened them.  
It reminded me that not everyone wants something from me.  
That some people just *see*, and *stay*.

And today, for the first time in a long time, I let someone in.  
Maybe this is what care really looks like.

And maybe… I’m ready to receive it.
