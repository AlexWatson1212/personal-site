I shoved pocket threes on the button over a cutoff open in a $100 Bounty Builder.

He had 21 BB. I had 25. The blinds were short. There was a big chip leader elsewhere, and a short stack still in. I knew — intuitively — it was a strong spot to apply pressure. I didn’t hesitate.

And he woke up with tens.

It’s easy to look at that and feel like I punted. To wonder if I should’ve preserved my second-place stack and waited for a better spot.

But *on reflection* — I wouldn’t change a thing.

This wasn’t a reckless play. It was a deeply informed one. In bounty tournaments, the structure rewards aggression. It rewards pressure. It rewards the courage to *go for it* when the dynamics are right.

And the dynamics were *perfect*.

He opens wide in the cutoff. I cover him. There’s ICM pressure. There’s fold equity. I’m likely to either take the pot down uncontested, or get called by hands like Ace-Queen or Ace-King and flip for a bounty and a huge stack.

And if I *do* get called by the top of his range? Like tens?

That’s just variance.

What’s really important is this:

> I didn’t hesitate. It was intuitive. And I’ve learned to lean into that more and more.

That instinct — that clarity under pressure — is something I’ve earned. It wasn’t noise. It wasn’t tilt. It was a clear signal rising out of hundreds of hours of experience.

And even though I lost the hand, I walked away proud.

Because I played to win. And I trusted myself.

That’s the long game.
