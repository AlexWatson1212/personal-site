Some nights remind me: it doesn’t have to be heavy.

Tonight, I slowed down.  
I didn’t rush to be the “good parent.”  
I just *was*. And that was enough.

Here’s the rhythm I want to carry with me — a simple pattern that leaves space for both of us to feel held.

## 🌼 Evening Primrose Routine

**1. After Pickup: Let Us Both Land**  
- Talk in the car, but don’t rush the vibe.  
- No immediate switch into “task mode.”  
- Maybe a sofa sit. Maybe a silly snack.  
→ *“Let’s just arrive together.”*

**2. Choose Connection First**  
- PlayStation, a quick game, a laugh.  
- Something small that says: *“I’m here with you.”*  
→ *Let warmth come before work.*

**3. Meal Prep without Pressure**  
- He’s okay. He’s not demanding.  
- The pressure comes from me — from a performative script I didn’t choose.  
→ *I don’t need to earn being a good dad. I already am.*

**4. Let Him Be Free, Let Me Breathe**  
- He plays online.  
- I take time for myself in the back room.  
→ *I’m not abandoning him. I’m resourcing myself.*

## 🌿 A Thought to Hold

> *“Presence doesn’t mean performance.  
It means being real,  
And staying with myself  
While I stay with him.”*

If I forget this rhythm, I can return to it.  
If I lose myself for a moment, I can begin again.  
He doesn’t need a perfect dad — just a real one.

And tonight, I remembered how to be both.
