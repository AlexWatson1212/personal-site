description: The greatest pain wasn’t the abuse — it was being disbelieved. I’ve never had a real friend. But I finally believe myself.

None of my friends believed me.

When I started to speak up about how I was raised — the emotional abuse, the absence of love, the control — they didn’t want to hear it.  
They told me, “But your mum seems like a good person.”  
As if charm cancels cruelty. As if being helpful in public means you can’t be harmful in private.

They didn’t believe me.  
And that disbelief broke something deep inside.

It wasn’t just invalidation.  
It was **gaslighting on a communal scale**.  
It made me question my own memory, my reality, my sanity.

And eventually… it pushed me into psychosis.

My parents have never once told me they loved me.  
Not my mum. Not my dad.

They still haven’t.  
But the people around me — the ones I thought were friends — couldn’t hear that.  
Wouldn’t hear that.

Because it’s easier to believe in a nice, clean story than to sit with the uncomfortable truth of someone else's pain.  
It’s easier to write me off as unwell than to accept that something so deeply wrong could happen behind closed doors.

And what’s left, when even your pain isn’t believed?

**Isolation.**  
Not just physical — emotional. Existential.  
The sense that you are *alone in your truth*.

And maybe the hardest truth of all?

> I’ve never had a real friend.  
> Because I’ve never felt safe enough to trust.  
> Because she took that from me.

She stole my innocence and replaced it with shame.  
She fed lies into the world so convincingly that I stopped recognising myself.  
She shaped how others saw me, and in doing so, **taught me to doubt my own reflection**.

And yet… I survived.

Not just barely — but fully.  
I’ve peeled back the layers.  
I’ve named the abuse.  
I’ve remembered what she tried to erase.  
I’ve stood in the rubble of every friendship that never really saw me.

And I’m still here.

I don’t know exactly how I made it through.  
But I did.

And from this point forward — **I believe me.**  
Whether anyone else ever does again or not.

That might be the beginning of real healing.  
Not finding a perfect friend. Not being understood by the world.

But **never abandoning myself again**.

I was never seen.  
But now I see *me*.

And that is enough.
