I don’t miss my mother.

Not in the way I used to think I should.  
Not in the way people tell you you’re supposed to.  
Not even in the way that feels socially acceptable to admit.

I used to spiral around this.  
What kind of person doesn’t miss their mum?  
What does that say about me?  
Am I cold? Broken? Unloving?

But now… I just feel free.

Life is *so much better* without her in it.

She was — and still is — emotionally exhausting.  
I would say things like, *“I’m tired, I don’t have the energy for a lot of talking,”* and she would just bulldoze through that boundary. Push and push and push until she got her needs met — regardless of what I’d clearly expressed.

And it wasn’t a one-off. It was the pattern.  
Every time.

It took me years to realise it, but I was never seen as a separate emotional being in that relationship. I was a container. A mirror. A service animal for her dysregulation.

And when I finally stepped away from that role, I found something unexpected:  
**Peace.**

I’m not angry anymore.  
I’m not grieving the mother I wish I had.  
I’m just… *done.*

There’s a caveat, of course.  
Victor recently said he wanted to see her dog — and yeah, that complicates things a little. I told him we could visit briefly if he keeps asking, but I’d never leave him alone with her again. Not after what I’ve lived through. Not now that I know better.

And even that — the clarity that I can hold a boundary for him while still offering him some access — is a sign of how far I’ve come.

The truth is, I don’t feel emotionally charged around this anymore.  
I just feel **clean**.  
And in that clarity, I’ve realised something that used to terrify me:

> I’d be perfectly content to never speak to her again.  
> Not out of hatred — but out of self-respect.

Some people say you only get one mother.  
But I’ve come to believe that you get *many* chances in life to be mothered — by the right people, in the right ways, at the right time.

And sometimes, the first act of real mothering is to say:
> “No more. I deserve peace.”

It’s not anger anymore. It’s not grief.  
It’s just space.  
And in that space, I’ve found freedom.
