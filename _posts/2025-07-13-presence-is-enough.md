I’ve spent years trying to understand myself—trying to make sense of my patterns, my coping strategies, my loneliness, my longing.

And lately, I’ve peeled back a layer that has felt both brutal and clarifying: the realization that I’ve sometimes pushed people away through my own unconscious patterns—through helping too much, or holding too tightly, or offering insight when all someone needed was space.

But I want to be fair to myself.

Because I’ve also been present. I’ve shown up with openness, kindness, and sincerity in more relationships than I’ve been given credit for. And the truth is, not all of those relationships ended because of me. Some people simply didn’t have the capacity. Some weren’t a good fit. Some were passing chapters. That’s life.

What’s different now is that I’m no longer tying myself in knots to figure out *why* someone didn’t stay.

I’m beginning to trust something simpler:

**Presence is enough.**

I don’t need to fix.  
I don’t need to impress.  
I don’t need to turn my pain into insight in every conversation.  
I don’t need to manage anyone’s emotions.  
I can just show up. Be here. Respond in real time. Let people come as they are—and let myself come as I am too.

And if that’s not enough for someone, then they’re not my people.

That doesn’t make them bad. Or me bad. It just means our energies don’t align. And that’s okay.

There’s a freedom in this that I’ve never fully let myself feel before. The freedom to put the theory down. To let go of the hyper-vigilance. To stop scanning for how I’m coming across. To release the idea that connection must be earned.

It doesn’t.  
It just needs to be allowed.

And I’m allowing it now.
