There was a time when I wanted people to see that I was healing. That I was thriving. That I was rising from the ashes with something to show for it.

I’d subtly hint at growth. Try to sound grounded. Make sure I looked like I had it all together.

But now? I don’t need to prove I’m doing well.

Some of my biggest shifts have been silent. Internal. Invisible. Things only *I* would notice—like the pause before reacting, the ability to sit with discomfort, the choice to stay in instead of people-please my way into burnout.

No applause. No Instagram post. Just self-trust, built moment by moment.

It feels different now. I don’t need someone else’s validation to confirm my progress.

I know I’m growing because I’m the one living it.
