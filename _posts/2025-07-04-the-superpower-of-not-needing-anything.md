There’s this guy on YouTube—Dwayne from Dry Creek Wrangler School. He’s not an influencer or a performer. He’s a man with a farm who happens to share stories online. And there’s something about the way he speaks that cuts through all the noise. One thing he said stuck with me deeply:

> “I don’t need anyone. I want people in my life. But if they treat me wrong, I walk away.”

It sounds simple. But for someone like me, it’s revolutionary.

I’ve spent most of my life clinging—out of politeness, out of fear, out of guilt. I stayed in friendships long after they drained me. I tolerated jobs, dynamics, even moments of disrespect, because I thought *walking away* meant failure. Or worse, that it made me a bad person.

But over time, I’ve come to realise something liberating: **I don’t need anything.**

That doesn’t mean I’m closed off. I’d love to find a great partner. I’d welcome real friendship. But I no longer *need* them to feel whole. And that changes everything.

Because when you stop needing, you stop tolerating what doesn’t align with your self-respect.

I no longer force conversations with people who wouldn’t care if I disappeared. I no longer chase connection from those who don’t meet me with the same depth I offer. I no longer compromise my peace for the sake of being liked.

That’s not bitterness. It’s clarity.

There’s a power in not needing. A quiet, grounded strength. You stop begging life to be something it’s not. You stop contorting yourself to fit other people’s comfort. You just... walk your path.

And what’s wild is, when you walk like that—when your worth isn’t up for negotiation—you actually start attracting better. Not out of desperation. But because you’re aligned.

It’s taken me years to get here. I still wobble sometimes. But more and more, I’m learning to trust that my peace isn’t worth trading—not for attention, not for validation, not for temporary belonging.

So thank you, Dwayne, for putting words to something I’ve been living my way into.

I don’t need anything. And in that space, life becomes full of *want*—not lack.

And that… is freedom.
