I’ve been noticing something lately.

A recent moment of respect or consideration from my ex — even if it was just about our son — stirred something deeper in me. Not longing. Not regret. Just... reflection.

For a second, I found myself thinking:  
*“Was it all my fault?”*  
*“Was there something healthy there that I just ruined?”*

That’s not my grounded self speaking. That’s the voice of the **critical parent** within me — the one that always assumes I’m the problem. The one that finds ways to blame me whenever things feel unclear.

### 🪞 Projection and Misunderstanding

I don’t think I saw her clearly — but I don’t think she saw me clearly either.

She projected things onto me: that I was controlling, difficult, unsafe. And maybe, in moments, I did act in ways that reflected those labels. But they weren’t the whole truth.  
The projections *shaped* me. They pressed on insecurities that already lived in me.  
And the more I tried to prove I wasn’t those things, the more entangled I became.

That’s how misunderstanding becomes a self-fulfilling loop.

### 🧩 The Need to Understand the Scraps

I’m not trying to fix it.  
I’m not even trying to justify it.

I’m just trying to **understand the scraps** — the fragments of what was, the emotional dust left behind — so I can build something more *whole* next time.

Because I don’t want to bring confusion into the next connection.  
I don’t want to defend myself from ghosts.  
I don’t want to prove I’m good to someone who’s already chosen not to see it.

### 🧱 A New Foundation

So I revisit the past — not to live in it — but to mine it for wisdom.  
What did I ignore?  
What did I mistake for love?  
What parts of me were never safe to show?

The answers aren’t always clear. But they’re honest.

And honesty — not perfection — is what I want to build the next relationship on.

### 📝 A Note to My Future Self (and to My Son, if You Ever Read This)

If you're ever in a relationship again and start to feel like you have to prove your worth — pause.

You don’t have to shrink, perform, or defend who you are.  
The right person will *see you*, not just project something onto you.  
They’ll want to understand, not just be right.  
They’ll meet you — not manage you.

And if you're reading this, son:  
Know that even when things didn’t work out between your parents, I kept learning.  
Not just for me. For you.  
So you'd grow up seeing that love doesn’t mean losing yourself.

We can always begin again — but this time, from truth.
