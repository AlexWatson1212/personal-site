There’s been a slow shift happening inside me — not loud, but steady. I’ve realized I don’t want to play poker every day. And not because I’m losing. Not because I’m burnt out. But because it no longer feels like *me*.

Poker has given me financial stability this year. My outgoings match what I’ve made, and that’s no small feat. I’ve grown through it — developed discipline, patience, emotional regulation. It’s taught me more than I expected.

But it's not my purpose.

It’s started to feel like a job I never meant to have. Waking early, loading up tournaments, forcing myself to play when I don’t want to. It’s become something I do because it gives me *an answer* to the question, “What do you do?”

And maybe that’s the real thing I’m shedding — not the game, but the need to have an identity wrapped around it.

I think I'd rather play once a week. Dive into a few meaningful tournaments now and then. Study a bit more. Play better, not more. That way, it becomes something sustainable. Enjoyable. A skill I use — not a mask I wear.

This morning I didn’t want to play. I wanted to rest. So I did.

And for once, I didn’t feel guilty.

I’m starting to believe that rest isn't nothing. It's preparation. It's soil.

And maybe the most important thing I'm learning isn’t how to win a game — it's how to *let go of the grind without letting go of myself*.
