Sometimes the body registers the truth before the mind can name it.

That drop in energy — the sudden fatigue, the tightening in the chest, the sinking feeling in the gut — it’s not random. It’s not laziness. It’s not weakness. It’s your body responding to something it deeply understands:

You’ve been left out. Again.

And not because you didn’t try, or because you weren’t good enough. In fact, perhaps *because* you were too much of something — too honest, too strong, too perceptive, too unwilling to play the game. Too true.

---

There’s something unbearable about being quietly excluded with no explanation. It forces you to hold a strange contradiction: knowing you did your best, and yet being made to feel like you’re the problem.

The body feels it. It always has. Even when we were younger — when the teacher overlooked us, or a parent gave love conditionally, or a friend pulled away without saying why — our body carried the weight.

And now, as adults, the same wound flares when history repeats.

---

So what do we do?

We *feel* it.

We *name* it.

We *hold* ourselves through it — not because we’re trying to fix it, but because our nervous system needs to know we’re here now. That *someone* is listening. That we won’t abandon ourselves too.

Sometimes that means resting. Sometimes that means crying. Sometimes it means putting a hand on your chest and whispering, “I know, love. That really hurt. But I’m still here.”

---

This isn’t about blaming the people who left us out. It’s about refusing to gaslight ourselves out of what we’re feeling. It’s about reclaiming the truth that:

- You *do* deserve feedback.
- You *did* show up fully.
- You *are* worthy of belonging.

And when others can’t see that — or won’t — it becomes our responsibility to stand by ourselves all the more.

---

Right now, the body might be exhausted. That’s okay.

Let it be tired. Let it grieve.

And when it’s ready, it will rise again — with even more integrity, more gentleness, more strength.

Because the body *knows*. And when we listen, it teaches us how to stay soft in a world that often feels cold.
