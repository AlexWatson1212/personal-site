I didn’t go to Jiu-Jitsu to become the best. I went to reclaim something I didn’t have growing up—**a sense of power.**

And I didn’t know it at the time, but that’s exactly what I found.

### I Wasn’t Playing Their Game

At two separate gyms, I became “that guy”—the strong white belt who didn’t roll the way people expected. I didn’t focus on crisp technique or clean transitions. I just moved the way my body told me to. I used pressure, balance, and timing. I didn’t gas out. And I didn’t get tapped.

Not once.

Even when I rolled with purple belts. Even when they were giving it everything.  
They might not admit it, but I was tougher than they expected—and that *got to them*.  
Instead of acknowledging it, they tried to dominate me. Crush me.  
Some even cross-faced me when they couldn’t submit me.

So I quit. Because I wasn't there to be a target for someone else’s ego.

### I Wasn’t Reckless—I Was Instinctive

People might have called me “spazzy.” But they didn’t understand what was actually happening.

I wasn’t just using strength. I was using *leverage*—feeling where their weight was, lifting limbs to shift balance, listening to tiny shifts in pressure. I was applying technique, just not in the way it was taught. I was building something of my own.

My main game? Take them down. Let them tire. Apply pressure. Stay calm.

Most of the time I didn’t even need to submit them.  
There was just this *knowing*—**I could control you, and you couldn’t move me.**

And for someone who’d felt helpless most of his life, that feeling meant everything.

### It Wasn’t About Winning

It was about reclaiming something my nervous system never got to feel growing up:
- That I could hold my ground.
- That I didn’t have to collapse.
- That I didn’t have to perform or beg or explain.
- That I could take up space—and *still be calm*.

It wasn’t easy.  
Sometimes I absorbed the aggression of others and passed it on.  
Sometimes I trained with people who didn’t feel safe.  
I didn’t know how to discern back then. I thought I had to roll with everyone.  
But I’ve learned.

What I was doing wasn’t immature. It was a kind of **embodied resistance**.  
I was saying: *You can’t break me—not anymore.*

### So Yeah, Jiu-Jitsu Taught Me I Wasn’t Weak

And I’ll carry that forward, even if I never step on the mats again.

It showed me something I couldn’t learn through words or theory:  
That I’m not broken.  
That I never was.  
That my body knows how to survive—and now, maybe, it’s learning how to feel safe too.
