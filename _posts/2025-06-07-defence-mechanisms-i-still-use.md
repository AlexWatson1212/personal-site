I’ve done a lot of work.  
But I’m still human.  
And that means I still defend myself — sometimes without realising it.

Not with fists or walls.  
But with subtle habits.  
The kind that show up when I feel vulnerable, exposed, or just a little too seen.

**Here are a few of my go-tos:**

- **Advising.**  
When someone shares something difficult, I jump in with solutions. Not because I think I know better — but because I’m uncomfortable with their pain. It’s easier to fix than to feel.

- **Derailing with humour.**  
Humour has always been my shield. It lightens the moment, but sometimes it lifts me right out of my body. Right out of connection.

- **Filtering.**  
I only share parts of the truth — the parts that feel safe, polished, acceptable. But the full truth? That’s where the real healing lives.

- **Identifying.**  
Instead of just listening, I turn the moment into my own story. “That happened to me too…” — It’s not ill-intentioned, but it often disconnects me from the other person.

- **Judging.**  
It’s a fast way to feel safe: if I can put someone else in a box, I don’t have to feel my own discomfort. But judgment is a veil over curiosity.

- **Mind-reading.**  
I assume I know what others are thinking — usually something critical. It's exhausting. And it usually says more about my own inner critic than theirs.

I’m not ashamed of these.  
They were tools I developed to survive.  
To navigate a world that didn’t always feel safe.

But now?  
Now I want more.  
Real intimacy. Real presence. Real me.

And that means noticing when these defences show up — and choosing, slowly, to lower them.

Not all at once.  
Not perfectly.  
But intentionally.

Because that’s how I learn to stay open — even when it’s hard.  
That’s how I come home to myself.
