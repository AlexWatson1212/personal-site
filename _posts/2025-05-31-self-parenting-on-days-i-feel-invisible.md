Some days I wake up and feel… invisible.

Like I could disappear for a while and no one would really notice. Not in a dramatic way—just a subtle sense of not being fully held in anyone’s awareness.

And in the past, that would’ve spiraled. I would’ve reached out to someone. Sought validation. Tried to prove I mattered by being useful, interesting, or available.

But now?

Now, I try something else.

I sit with the feeling. I place a gentle hand on my chest. I speak to the younger version of me who used to feel forgotten. I tell him: *“I see you. I’m proud of you. You matter to me.”*

Because sometimes the loneliness isn’t about people being absent. It’s about *me* being absent from myself.

Self-parenting isn’t about forcing myself to feel better. It’s about creating the conditions for me to feel seen, even when no one else is looking.

And slowly, that brings me back.

Not in a big dramatic way—but in a quiet, steady one.

Sometimes that’s all I need.
