title: "When Sharing Feels Risky — But Necessary"

Some stories feel heavier to share.

Not because they’re shameful in truth — but because they reveal a part of me I’ve kept hidden. A part that maybe isn’t “aligned” with the man I’m becoming. A part I still flinch around when I see it written in black and white.

But if I want to be truly authentic — and I do — then I can’t just share the polished pieces.  
I have to share the *messy*, *complicated*, *imperfect* ones too.

Because healing doesn’t happen in hiding.  
And growth doesn’t come from pretending.

## 🪶 The Post That Brought This Up

Recently, I posted about visiting a massage parlour — and receiving more than just a massage.  
And a part of me wanted to backdate it.  
To make it feel “less bad.”  
To avoid judgment — mine or someone else’s.

But that would’ve been an old performance.  
And the version of me writing this now isn’t interested in performance.

He’s interested in **truth**.  
Not as confession — but as clarity.

## 🧭 What This Is Really About

This isn’t about the act itself.  
It’s about the *unmet need underneath it*.  
The part of me that longs to be seen, touched, accepted — fully and without shame.

So if I sit with that discomfort and ask:
> “Does this behaviour align with who I want to be?”

Then I’m not punishing myself —  
I’m holding myself. Gently. Honestly. Accountably.

## 🌱 The Gift of Visibility

When I share something publicly, it becomes clearer to me.

- If it sits well, I know it’s true.
- If it doesn’t, I’ve just been handed a mirror.

Not to shame myself — but to say:
> *“This part of me is asking for something deeper. Can I give it that — in a way that honours who I’m becoming?”*

## 💬 The People Who Matter…

Not everyone will understand.  
Some will judge.  
Some will miss the nuance and the humanity.

But those aren’t the people I’m building with.  
Those aren’t the ones I’m becoming emotionally available for.

> *“The people who matter won’t mind.  
And the people who mind don’t matter.”*

I’m not here to be perfect.  
I’m here to be real.

And if my truth makes me flinch —  
Then maybe that’s the exact reason it needs to be seen.
