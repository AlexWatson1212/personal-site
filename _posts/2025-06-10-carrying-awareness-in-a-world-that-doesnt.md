title: "Carrying Awareness in a World That Doesn’t"

Today, I noticed myself getting annoyed when someone let their dog jump on a passerby.  

He saw the person coming.  
He could’ve called the dog back.  
He didn’t.  
No apology. No eye contact. Just moved on.

And for a moment, I felt *more* than annoyed.  
I felt invisible. Dismissed.  
Disrespected—on behalf of the stranger, and maybe on behalf of myself.

At first glance, it might seem small.  
But it touched something deeper:  
> **A lifetime of having to be aware when others aren’t.**

I've always been the one who *notices*.  
Who adjusts.  
Who considers other people’s space, tone, feelings, limits.

So when someone doesn’t even apologise for a blatant intrusion, it stings.  
Not because I need perfection—  
But because I’ve spent so much of my life carrying awareness for others who didn’t carry it themselves.

---

And maybe there’s another layer.  
Maybe part of me feels a little envious of his *ease*—  
his ability to walk through the world without that kind of weight.

There’s a part of me that wonders:
> *“What would it be like to not worry about everyone else for once?”*

But the truth is, I *value* that I notice.  
I *like* that I’m respectful of others.  
It’s part of who I am. It’s something I want to model for my son, for the people around me.

It just gets heavy sometimes.  
Especially when it feels like no one else is carrying it with me.

---

So maybe the annoyance wasn’t just about the dog.

Maybe it was the quiet voice in me saying:  
> “I’m tired. I carry a lot. And I wish more people would meet me halfway.”

---

That doesn’t mean I stop caring.  
But it *does* mean I get to have compassion for the part of me that’s been over-functioning for far too long.  
And maybe, when it makes sense, I can put the weight down for a bit.

Even awareness needs rest.
