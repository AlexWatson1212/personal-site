I guess I’ve still got a little bit of imposter syndrome with my website.

In actual fact, I’ve kind of tried to remove that by saying — this is just for me. It’s my self-reflective tool. If someone else can benefit from it, beautiful. But I’m not building it for validation.

And yet, the vision quietly grows.

I haven’t even reached the deeper potential of what it could become — a space where others could use simple Notion templates to explore who they are, and maybe even turn that into a site of their own. That’s where the beauty lives: not in the product, but in the invitation. My work becomes a kind of mirror — not perfect, but honest. A way to say: this is what it looks like when someone tries.

Of course, it heals me too. And it gives me purpose. I want to become a more refined person — not to show off, but to live in alignment. To feel complete, even in my incompleteness.

And I think it’s important that I keep showing the parts where I didn’t feel complete. Where I was unsure. Where I doubted myself. Because if I don’t, people might look at me in five years and think I’ve always had it together. That I’ve always been this whole, grounded version of myself.

But that won’t be true. Even then, I won’t be “finished.” I’ll just be further along.

So maybe the real offering is this:
To show the parts of myself I used to feel ashamed of.
To make visible the places I hid.
To build a condition for connection — and for growth.

Because if I can do that, maybe someone else will feel safe enough to try too.
