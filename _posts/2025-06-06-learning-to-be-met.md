When someone truly sees us,  
it can feel overwhelming.  
Exposing.  
Almost… too much.

But learning to *receive* that — to let ourselves be met —  
is a powerful part of becoming whole.

I wasn’t used to it.

Someone looked at me — and stayed.  
They didn’t turn away when I said how I felt.  
They didn’t flinch when I named a fear.  
They just… listened.

And I almost ran.

### 💡 It’s Hard to Receive What You Never Had

When you’re used to being the giver, the listener, the one who holds the space —  
Letting someone meet *you* can feel threatening.

“What if I’m too much?”  
“What if they leave?”  
“What if I trust this… and it disappears?”

But this is the work.  
Not just offering presence to others —  
but learning to *accept* it for yourself.

> What part of being seen feels most uncomfortable for me?  
> Can I trace that discomfort back to an earlier experience?

### 🌱 It’s a Practice

Learning to be met isn’t about finding the “perfect” person.  
It’s about recognising when you're safe enough to stop hiding.

Being met doesn’t mean you're under a spotlight.  
It’s a shared glow.  
A space where both people show up — and stay.

And it doesn’t mean you have to be vulnerable with everyone.  
Just that you stop abandoning *yourself*  
when someone finally sees you.

You meet them there.  
You meet *you* there.

> ✏️ **Final Reflection:**  
> Where in my life have I felt truly met — even briefly?  
> What would it mean to let that happen more often?
