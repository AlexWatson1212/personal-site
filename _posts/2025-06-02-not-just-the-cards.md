Some days, it’s not just the hands I lose — it’s what they represent.

Today, I made the right moves. I played the math. I stayed disciplined. I kept showing up.  
And still… I lost.

- **Sevens vs. Ace-Jack:** flipped deep in a major — gone.  
- **Nines vs. Jacks in a bounty builder turbo:** over-shoved with 20 bigs, gone.  
- **Bubble pressure hands:** played smart, walked away empty.

And it’s not that the individual hands were bad. They weren’t.  
It’s the **accumulation** that gets me.

### 🧠 When Poker Feeds the Inner Critic

Some days, these losses just roll off.  
But today, they hit deeper.  
Today, they touched that place that still believes *“I’m not enough.”*

And I know — rationally — that’s not true.  
But emotionally? After a day of grief, of sitting with the pain of not being held, of never really having my needs met… poker just *mirrored it back to me.*

The randomness. The helplessness.  
The **longing to be rewarded** for doing things right — and still watching it fall apart.

That’s not about cards.  
That’s about life.

### 💔 The Weight I Was Already Carrying

I’ve been sitting with the grief of never being held.  
Not properly. Not consistently.  
I’ve had to be my own comfort for as long as I can remember.

And it’s exhausting.

So when the flips don’t go my way, it’s not just about the chips.  
It’s about everything they reflect.

> *“Even when I show up well… I don’t win.”*  
> *“Even when I try… it’s not enough.”*

That’s not tilt. That’s trauma.

And I’m naming it, not to drown in it — but to move through it.

### 🎯 And Then I Hit the 8

Later in the same tournament, I shoved **Ace-9 off for seven bigs** into a short-stacked UTG opener with a $20 bounty.  
He flipped over **Aces.** Of course he did.  
But somehow — *I hit a straight on the turn.* I won.

And then again — **Ace-8 offsuit**, I shoved for eight bigs.  
Called by **Ace-5 suited**. Then **Ace-King suited** behind that.  
And somehow — *I hit an 8.*

I didn’t celebrate wildly. I didn’t feel redeemed.  
But I felt *something shift.*

> Not everything goes against me.  
> Not every hand ends in silence.  
> Sometimes, I hit the 8.  
> And that’s enough — for now.

### 🕊️ The Real Game I’m Playing

I’m not just playing poker.  
I’m playing the long game of healing.  
The game of staying regulated when life (and variance) keeps saying *“Not yet.”*

And I’m not broken because it gets to me.  
I’m not weak because I feel it more on some days.

I’m just someone who’s lost more than his fair share —  
But still keeps sitting down,  
Still keeps showing up,  
Still keeps hoping for the next card to fall in his favour.

And sometimes, it does.
