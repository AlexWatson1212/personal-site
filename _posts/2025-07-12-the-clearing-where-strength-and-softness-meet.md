Right now, I feel something deep.  
A kind of self-acceptance I’ve never truly known.

Not the kind where I pretend everything is fine.  
But the kind where I can look at every part of myself — even the parts that hurt, even the parts that used to sabotage me — and say:  
> *“You belong. I’ve got you now.”*

I feel like I can stand up for myself — in every arena.  
I can speak my needs.  
I can be clear.  
I can be kind.  
I can stay.

### But It’s Not Just Pride I Feel

I also feel guilt.

Guilt for leaving people behind — even if they never truly supported me.  
Even if I had to shrink just to keep them in my life.  
Even if they were never really there in the first place.

And I feel shame, too — because I’m so alone right now.  
Because despite all the work I’ve done, all the insight, all the growth…  
I’m still sitting here in silence, unsure who to reach for.

But I also know this:

> **I am not alone because I’m unlovable.**  
> I’m alone because I’ve stopped accepting crumbs.  
> I’ve stopped pretending.  
> I’ve stopped performing.

And that changes everything.

### I’m In the Clearing

This place between the old life and the new.  
Between healing and connection.  
Between inner work and outer relationships.

And from here — something soft stirs beneath the shame:

> **Hope.**

Because I believe — when I approach others from a place of rest,  
When I move from a deep love and acceptance of myself,  
When I no longer reach to be filled, but to be seen...

I’ll meet the right people.  
Not all at once. Not easily. But honestly.

And this time, it won’t cost me myself.

This is where strength and softness meet.  
This is the clearing.  
And I am learning to call it home.
