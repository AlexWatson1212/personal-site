description: I’m not trying to become someone else — I’m learning to remove what’s not me. And every layer I shed reveals more of who I already am underneath.

Life isn’t about fixing myself.  
It’s about *unveiling* myself.

Not building a new identity.  
But slowly, honestly, peeling back the layers I put on to survive —  
the masks, the roles, the defences.  
All the ways I tried to stay safe in a world that didn’t know how to meet me.

---

And underneath it all?  
There’s someone there.  
Always has been.

Someone calm.  
Someone curious.  
Someone confident — not in the loud, puffed-up way,  
but in that grounded, quiet knowing that says: “I’m okay.”

> The more I soften, the more I see him.

He’s compassionate.  
Not just with others, but with me.  
He’s creative — not to prove anything, but because it’s how he breathes.  
He’s clear. He knows what matters.  
And when he doesn’t, he has the courage to sit with the unknown.

He’s joyful.  
Not in a performative way. But a gentle, surprising joy.  
The kind that sneaks in when I stop trying so hard.

And he’s generous —  
not just with time or energy,  
but with presence.  
With love.

This is who I am under the noise.  
Under the survival roles.  
Under the ache.

And the more I live from that place,  
the less I need to be *anything else*.

---

So I’ll keep going.  
Not to become more —  
but to *remember*.

To remember who I already am  
when I’m not trying to be who I’m not.

And in that remembering,  
I find peace.
