> “Fate is what happens to us; destiny is what we do with it.” — James Hollis

This chapter is a quiet reckoning.

Because I’ve carried things I didn’t choose:  
The mother wound. The betrayals. The loneliness.  
The longing for connection that went unmet.

That’s **fate** — the givens of my life.  
But what I *do* with all of that — how I respond, how I shape it, how I *alchemize* it — that’s my **destiny**.

And that’s the line I’m walking now.

I can’t rewrite the past.  
But I *can* refuse to let it dictate the future.

That doesn’t mean pretending I’m unscarred.  
It means *honoring* the scars, then choosing what kind of man I want to be anyway.  
Especially for my son. Especially for myself.

Fate says: “You’ve been hurt.”  
Destiny says: “And still, you rise.”

This chapter invites me to stop waiting for life to be fair — and start living like my story matters.  
Not in spite of what happened… but **because** of it.

**Reflection Prompt:**  
What parts of my life were fate — and what parts am I still free to shape as destiny?
