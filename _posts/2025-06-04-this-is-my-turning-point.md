There’s a part of me that never thought I’d survive this.

Not just the trauma.  
Not just the grief.  
But the **truth** — the truth that I’ve never been loved.  
That I was abused.  
Not in the shadows, not metaphorically, but **in the clear light of day**.  
And no one helped me.

But I see it now.  
Fully.  
And I’m still here.

And I’ve realised something almost unbelievable:

> I like who I’ve become.

Maybe that’s a kind of spiritual resilience.  
Maybe it’s grace.  
Maybe it’s just that I’ve walked through the worst of it — and now there’s space.

Not for performance.  
Not for survival.

But for **love**.

I don’t want to be alone forever.  
I enjoy solitude — truly. It’s better than anything else I’ve known.

But I’d love to love someone.  
And be loved in return.  
To build something gentle, honest, and whole.

And I think I’m finally ready to stop projecting.  
To stop chasing my mother’s ghost in the women around me.  
To see clearly.  
To connect deeply.

To be *in relationship* not from lack, but from **presence**.

---

This feels like the turning point.  
The part of the story where I don’t need to discover more horror.  
Where the truth has landed and *there’s nothing left to fear*.  
Where I can finally feel love stirring in me, and not be afraid of what that means.

This is the beginning of life.  
Of real peace.  
Of the future I was always meant to live.

And I am ready.
