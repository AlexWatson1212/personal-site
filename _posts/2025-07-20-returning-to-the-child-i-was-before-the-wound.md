When you stop living in rebellion… when you stop trying to prove you're not what someone else imagined you to be… something strange and quiet begins to happen.

A question starts to emerge:  
**Who am I, then?**

Not the person shaped by survival.  
Not the one acting out of defiance.  
Not the reaction to someone else’s control, neglect, or projection.  
But *me.*

Over the last couple of years, I’ve been slowly stripping it all back.  
And underneath it all, something surprising has started to surface.

I like dogs.  
I love my son.  
I like people, even if connection has felt hard.  
I like football.  
I still love Manchester United — just like I did when I was a kid.

That last one hits in a different way.

As a child, I loved United. I was good at football. Really good. But my parents never bought me a kit. Not once. Not because they couldn’t — they had the money. But because they didn’t want to. My cousins would give me last season’s kits, and that’s what I had. I was never allowed a proper one. And I think I know why now.

My mum hated that I was good at something.  
Because she wasn’t.  
Because she never played sport.  
Because she was jealous.

It’s a brutal thing to realise — that a parent can envy their child. That they can withhold love, attention, or even *a football shirt*, just to avoid seeing you shine.

And yet, here I am, in my thirties… buying United shirts for fun.  
Because I want to.  
Because I can.  
Because it heals something.

That moment — that small act — is me reparenting myself. Not as a concept, but as a *felt experience*. A quiet reclaiming of joy, agency, and dignity.

It doesn’t fix everything.  
It doesn’t undo the past.  
But it reminds me of something I never stopped needing to know:

That I’m allowed to love what I love.  
That I matter.  
That my childhood self was never the problem.

I’m not just trying to become someone new anymore.  
I’m trying to *return* — to the child I was before the wound.  
And give him what he was always worthy of.
