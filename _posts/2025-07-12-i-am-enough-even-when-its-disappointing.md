I am enough.  
There is nothing wrong with me.

There are preferences. There are temperaments. There are nervous systems.  
But I am not broken. I never was.

Only so many people will be able to meet me where I am — and that’s okay. The ones who can will feel like water. The rest will just pass through, like wind.  
It doesn’t mean I failed.  
It doesn’t mean I’m unlovable.

There are over seven billion people in the world. So the belief that *no one* could meet me is, frankly, false — even if it once felt true. That belief belonged to my wounded inner child. The one who learned that showing up too fully led to rejection, or abandonment, or punishment.

### The Stories That Still Echo

Even now, when someone offers support, a voice inside whispers:
> *“They only care because they’re paid.”*  
> *“They need you to be vulnerable so they can feel important.”*

But when I look closer — that story falls apart.

My new therapist charges £35 an hour — she could easily find another client and earn more.  
My manager at Barnardo’s has given me so much time, energy, and belief — not out of obligation, but because *he sees something in me*.  
These people aren’t performing care. They’re offering it.

I’m learning to believe them. Slowly. Gently. Not blindly — but without rejecting it before it lands.

### Looking Back

Maybe I *have* withdrawn. Maybe I *have* missed opportunities. Or maybe I’ve shown up more vulnerably than ever before — and the truth is, *some people couldn’t meet it*. Maybe I scared them with my openness. Maybe I made them feel things they weren’t ready to face in themselves.

And that’s not mine to carry.

Still — it’s disappointing. That part is real.  
Not everything gets wrapped in a tidy bow.  
Not everyone stays.

But none of this means I am wrong. Or broken. Or too much.

### What I Know Now

I enjoy time with myself. I enjoy time with my son — especially when I’m rested. I enjoy meaningful interactions in small doses. I’m not defective. I’m just attuned.

And yes — I’ve spent years believing I had to *heal* to be worthy. That I was a project to be fixed. That therapy was a tool to make me more palatable. And maybe my old therapist — consciously or not — fed that belief.

But I’m not doing that anymore.  
I’m not healing to become someone better.  
I’m healing to remember who I’ve always been.

So here’s where I’m landing:

> **I am enough.**  
> Even when I feel unseen.  
> Even when I’m disappointed.  
> Even when the people I’ve shown up for don’t show up back.

None of that takes away from the quiet, unshakeable truth at the core of me:

> **I am enough. I am worthy. I am whole.**
