description: A reflection on learning to trust the inner signals of my body and soul, and the slow, real relationship I’m building with myself—one check-in at a time.

For a long time, I didn’t really believe that a relationship with myself could be enough.

I said the words. I did the work. But somewhere deep down, I still felt that *until someone truly saw me, truly loved me*, I’d always be missing something.

And maybe that’s still partly true—I’m wired for connection. I want to be met.  
But something is shifting lately.

I’m learning to listen to my **energy** as communication from something deeper.  
Not just physical tiredness—but feedback from my *soul*.  

- When I walk the dog and feel lighter—that means something.  
- When I go to the gym and return feeling more myself—that means something.  
- When I tried to force myself into Level 4 and my body shut down, night after night—that meant something too.

At the time, I brushed it off.  
Told myself I was anxious, or just overthinking.  
But really, it was my soul saying *not now*.  
And now that I’ve listened? I feel lighter. Clearer. More aligned.

I’m starting to live by a **quiet compass**.

Not productivity. Not pressure.  
Just checking in and asking:

> *“What feels nourishing today?”*  
> *“Where do I feel energy rising?”*  
> *“What part of me is asking to be heard?”*

And I don’t always get it right.  
There are still inner conflicts.  
But the biggest shift is—I’m letting those parts *speak* now.  
I’m not exiling the child, or silencing the protector.  
I’m building a relationship with all of me.

And maybe, in the end, **that’s the relationship I’ve always needed most**.  
Not instead of others. But as the foundation for all of them.

Because when I can be with myself like this—with honesty, with softness, with presence—  
I think I’ll find it easier to be with others too.

Not to get something from them.  
But to share what I’m already learning to give myself.

One check-in at a time.
