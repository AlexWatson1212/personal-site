I remember the first time I heard it — Hendrix tearing through the amp with that opening wah pedal like he was pulling thunder from the earth.

*“I’m a voodoo child, Lord knows I’m a voodoo child.”*

I didn’t know what it meant. Not fully. But I felt it.  
And when I looked at my dad, I could see he did too.

This song is chaos and power and soul. It’s defiance. It’s freedom. It’s walking into a storm and deciding you're not afraid anymore.

Now, years later, I wonder if it was more than just a cool guitar riff.  
Maybe it was about becoming someone who **can leave**.  
Someone who **won’t be controlled**.  
Someone who knows how much energy it takes to stand up and say, *enough*.

When Hendrix sang about chopping down a mountain or standing next to a fire and making it rain — I think he was talking about **spiritual power**. Not ego. But the kind of power you find when you reclaim yourself.

That’s what it felt like for me, especially as I got older.  
Especially as I saw some of the emotional dynamics in my family more clearly.  
Especially with my mum.

It’s strange. My dad and I didn’t always have the words.  
But when this song came on, we didn’t need them.  
There was something mutual in that moment.  
Maybe a shared ache.  
Maybe a shared pride in seeing the fire in each other’s eyes.

It’s the song that made me fall in love with guitar.  
Because it wasn’t just music — it was expression.  
It said things I didn’t know how to say.  
It *screamed* when I couldn’t.

I’m still learning how to walk away from things that don’t serve me.  
Still learning how to channel the power, not suppress it.  
But every time I hear that song, I remember that I *can*.

And I remember the look on my dad’s face the first time he saw me really play.  
As if to say: *You’ve got it too.*

---

*“I didn’t mean to take up all your sweet time… I’ll give it right back one of these days.”*

Maybe not today.  
But one of these days — I’ll play this song for my son.  
And I’ll mean every note.
