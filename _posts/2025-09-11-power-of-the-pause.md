In this video, I reflect on the **power of the pause**—those small moments where life slows down just enough for us to notice something good. These moments, often called *glimmers*, may not be dramatic or life-changing on the surface. They can be as simple as the warmth of sunlight, the sound of birds, or the feeling of a deep breath.  

For me, learning to pause has been about retraining my nervous system. Instead of constantly scanning for danger, stress, or what’s missing, I’m beginning to notice what’s already here. These small pauses don’t erase the pain or struggles of life, but they help create balance.  

The truth is, healing isn’t just about working through trauma or hardship—it’s also about learning to let joy in. To allow presence. To trust that even in the middle of difficulty, there are still sparks of beauty to be found.  

When we pause, we create space for those sparks to land. And over time, those glimmers start to add up, weaving together a life that feels softer, steadier, and more alive.
