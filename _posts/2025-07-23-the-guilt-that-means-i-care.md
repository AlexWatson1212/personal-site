Lately, I’ve been feeling the guilt again.  
The kind that creeps in when my son asks for more time with me — and I can’t give it.

Not because I don’t want to.  
Because I *physically can’t* handle it right now.  
Not while holding everything else. Not while trying to rebuild myself from the inside out.

And that guilt? It lands hard.  
Because I know what it’s like to feel emotionally abandoned by a parent.  
I know what it’s like to be unseen.

And I would never want him to feel that — not from me.

But here’s the truth:  
I’m not withholding love.  
I’m not failing him.  
I’m protecting both of us by not giving what I don’t have.

Because if I give too much now and break, he loses everything.  
So instead, I give him **what’s real**: honesty, presence, protection, and the truth that he can *always* talk to me.

That’s more powerful than time alone.

There’s more guilt.  
Guilt that I haven’t built the life I wanted yet.  
Guilt that he has to spend time in a home where he’s often ignored.  
Guilt that I chose someone who was never emotionally equipped to co-parent.  
Guilt that her new partner — a man who doesn’t even see his own children — now sits in a position of influence in my son’s world.

And then the deeper fear.  
The one that every protective parent holds but never wants to speak:  
> *What if something happens and I’m not there?*

But even in that fear, I know this:  
My son knows I will *always* believe him.  
He knows my love is steady.  
He knows that with me, he is *safe*.

I haven’t failed.  
I’m rebuilding in real time — and he’s watching.

He’s watching me struggle, yes.  
But he’s also watching me tell the truth.  
He’s watching me protect what’s sacred.  
He’s watching me *stay* — when so many people leave.

So no, the guilt isn’t proof I’ve failed.

It’s proof I *care*.  
Deeply. Fiercely. Relentlessly.  
And caring in a broken world is already a kind of revolution.

I'm doing my best.  
And one day, that will be the foundation for his freedom.
