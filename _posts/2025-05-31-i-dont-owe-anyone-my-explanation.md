I used to explain everything.

Why I said no.  
Why I needed space.  
Why I didn’t want to go to the event, reply to the message, or stay in that dynamic.

I felt like I needed a watertight reason to honour my own needs.

But here’s what I’ve realised:

**I don’t owe anyone my explanation.**

If something feels off, that’s enough.  
If I need rest, that’s enough.  
If I walk away from a person, habit, or environment that drains me—*that’s enough.*

I don’t need to justify my boundaries to people who benefit from me having none.

I can be kind *and* clear.  
Grounded *and* unapologetic.

My peace doesn’t require a permission slip.

And my worth isn’t dependent on how well I explain myself to people who were never really listening anyway.

I know what I need now.

And that’s enough.
