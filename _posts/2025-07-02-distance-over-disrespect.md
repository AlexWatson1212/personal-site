Every time I set a boundary and choose distance over disrespect, something interesting happens:

I realise that **I’m more at peace with the silence than they are**.

I can walk past them.  
I don’t flinch.  
I don’t engage.  
And I don’t owe them anything.

But I wonder — do *they* feel the same?

## The Mirror They Didn’t Ask For

Every time they see me, quiet and steady, I imagine it reflects something back to them.  
A kind of mirror.

> A reminder of why I went quiet.  
> A reminder of how they acted.  
> A reminder that I’m no longer available for it.

And if there’s even a flicker of self-awareness in them, I imagine there’s **shame** there — whether they admit it or not.

Because silence after mistreatment *isn’t neutral*.  
It’s a verdict.  
Not shouted, not argued — just quietly lived.

## The Gift of Discomfort

Their discomfort isn’t something I take pleasure in.  
But I no longer take responsibility for it, either.

It’s not my job to manage other people’s shame.  
It’s not my role to fix the consequences of their choices.

I used to contort myself to avoid these moments — to keep the peace.  
But that peace was fake.  
It came at the cost of my own self-respect.

Now?  
I choose distance.

## Closing Thought

**Distance over disrespect** isn’t cold.  
It’s clarity.

It’s not revenge.  
It’s recovery.

And when silence speaks louder than confrontation ever could,  
you don’t need to explain yourself.

You just keep walking.
