I’m in the middle of a downswing right now.

Rebuys piling up. Variance doing its thing.  
Four bullets gone in one tournament. Two in another.  
And every time — I played it right.

Not perfectly. But with clarity, focus, and sound decisions.  
And still, the hands didn’t hold. The flips didn’t flip.  
The money bled. Slowly. Honestly. With nothing I could’ve done differently.

But here’s what’s starting to land:

When something *does* go well — when I run deep, when I hit a score,  
I *deserve* it.  
Not in an entitled way. Not because I’m owed.  
But because I’ve **earned** it.

Not just through good play —  
but through staying upright in the storm.

Poker, strangely, is becoming one of my deepest teachers.

It’s not just a game. It’s a mirror.  
A test of patience, trust, self-worth.

And this time, when the win comes…  
I won’t call it luck.

I’ll call it **me**.
