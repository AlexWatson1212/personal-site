You made me carry everything you refused to face.

Your sadness.  
Your insecurity.  
Your rage.  
Your shame.  

You held onto control like it was love,  
and I bent myself into shapes to keep the peace â€”  
until I didnâ€™t even know who I was anymore.

You say you love me, but love that costs me my self isnâ€™t love.  
Itâ€™s possession. Itâ€™s guilt. Itâ€™s survival.  
And Iâ€™ve finally stopped surviving *you*.

You dripped shame into me drop by drop â€”  
until I couldnâ€™t tell where yours ended and mine began.  
But I know now.  
It was never mine to hold.

You donâ€™t get to call me selfish  
for walking away from a dynamic that broke me.  
You donâ€™t get to spin the story now that Iâ€™ve stopped playing my part.

And maybe now youâ€™re drowning in your own shame,  
and maybe that hurts â€”  
but I wonâ€™t be the life raft this time.

You had decades.  
You had chances.  
And still, you chose power over presence.  
Control over connection.  
Image over intimacy.

Well, I choose *me* now.

And I wonâ€™t apologise for it.

### ðŸŒ± A Quiet Reflection

Like a wildflower growing through cracked concrete,  
sometimes healing doesnâ€™t look soft â€” it looks *defiant*.  
It grows in silence. It roots in pain. It reaches for light anyway.

And so do I.
