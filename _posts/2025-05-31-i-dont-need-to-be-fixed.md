There was a time I saw myself as broken.

Too emotional. Too quiet. Too reactive. Too unsure.  
I thought healing meant *changing everything* about who I was.

But I see it differently now.

**I’m not broken. I don’t need to be fixed.**

I’ve just learned some unhelpful patterns.  
Picked up wounds from places that couldn’t hold me.  
Internalised voices that weren’t mine.

And now?  
I’m slowly unlearning.

Not to *become* someone new—but to return to myself.

Healing isn’t about erasing the past.  
It’s about meeting it with compassion.  
Integrating the lessons.  
And remembering that I’ve always been worthy—even before the work began.

There’s nothing wrong with me.  
There never was.

I’m not a problem to solve.  
I’m a person learning to live more freely—and more fully.

That’s enough.
