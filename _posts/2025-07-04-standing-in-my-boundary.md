## Standing in My Boundary: I Don’t Need to Discuss It with You

This has been forming for years.

You spend so long trying to be fair, trying to be reasonable, trying to make peace. You give people the benefit of the doubt. You try to explain yourself calmly. But eventually, you reach a point where you’ve seen the pattern enough times to know exactly how it ends — and that’s the moment you stop.

That’s the moment you draw the line — not just in wood and concrete, but in your body, your nervous system, your life.

I’ve had consistent difficulty with a neighbour who has shown me, again and again, that he cannot interact with me respectfully. He’s been aggressive at my door. Threatened to fight me over nothing. Spoken to me with open disdain. And most tellingly: **he’s never once apologised**.

And I realise now, with full clarity:  
**That behaviour forfeits access.**  
You don’t get to threaten violence and then expect conversation.  
You don’t get to cross the line and then demand to be heard.

So I’ve made a decision.

I’m removing two fence panels — **the ones I can reuse elsewhere** — and I’m going to build a new fence in a way that fully honours my space. It’s **a slatted wood fence**, set **recessed back from the original line**, constructed **entirely on my land**. It’ll be **6 foot 6**, the **maximum legal height**, and fully within my rights.

He hasn’t contributed in over a decade. I owe him nothing. There will still be a fence. It’ll just be stronger, cleaner, and entirely mine.

And when he comes knocking — because I know he will — I’m not answering.

He lost that right the moment he brought aggression to my door.  
And if he knocks politely?  
He still doesn’t get to demand a conversation.

## I Don’t Need to Discuss It with You

If he catches me outside, I might say this once:

> **“I don’t need to discuss it with you.”**

That’s it.  
No anger. No explanation.  
Just truth.

If he continues, I’ll walk away.  
If he escalates, I’ll document it.  
But I won’t justify myself to someone who’s already shown he doesn’t care to listen.

This is important not just because of him — but because **people like this exist in every area of life**. People who only respect power, not kindness. People who push until you push back harder. And I’m not playing that game anymore.

## The Real Work

This has been about more than a fence.

It’s been about dignity. Self-respect. Choosing not to entertain disrespect in any form — no matter how close to home it lands.

And it’s about what I’m teaching my son, too.

He gets to see that his dad won’t be bullied. That you can hold your ground without becoming cruel. That silence is sometimes the loudest truth. That not all people are owed your energy, especially if they’ve shown they can’t handle it with care.

I used to feel like I had to make everyone understand.  
Now I realise: **some people *need* you to explain so they can twist it.**  
And the most powerful thing you can do is… not play.

## The New Standard

If someone acts like a child, that’s on them.  
If they lash out because they’re not in control, that’s their insecurity showing.

And if they ever want access to my energy again?  
They’ll need to come with humility and repair.  
Otherwise, **they’ll be met with silence — not spite, just clarity.**

I’ve got a home to protect. A son to raise. A life to live.

And I don’t need to discuss it with you.
