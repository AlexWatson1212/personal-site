description: A moment in therapy opened a question I can’t stop thinking about — how different would my life have been if I’d had a real mother?
emotions: [grief, longing]

Something happened in therapy today.  
My therapist responded to my experience with poker in a way that felt… safe. Present.  
She didn’t elevate me. She didn’t question me. She didn’t ask if it was stable or sustainable.  
She just *met me there.*

And it hit something deep.

Because when I talk about poker with my mother, I feel judged. Dismissed. Like I’m doing something shameful or foolish.  
And today I realised:  
> *It’s not just about poker. It’s about everything.*  

I’ve never known what it’s like to be met with genuine curiosity, encouragement, or belief — especially when I’m doing something outside her control.

I started to wonder:  
**How much more would I have made — emotionally, financially, creatively — if I’d had a real mother?**  
One who saw me. One who responded like my therapist did today.  
One who didn’t relate to me through fear, control, or contempt.

I don’t mean a perfect mother. I just mean… a *present* one.  
One who knew how to nurture, not manage.

There’s grief in that.  
Not just for the lost money or missed opportunities — but for the inner freedom I didn’t have.  
For the versions of myself that never got to fully unfold.  
For the love that should have been the soil beneath my life — but wasn’t.

---

I still did okay.  
I survived.  
I even built something.

But I’m allowed to mourn what could have been.  
And I’m allowed to keep becoming the kind of parent — to myself, to my son — that I never had.
