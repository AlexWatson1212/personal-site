Lately I’ve been sitting with something I usually try to avoid:  
That deep, quiet feeling of **emptiness**.

It’s not loud. It doesn’t scream or demand anything from me.  
It’s just *there* — like a still fog resting over everything.  
Not sadness exactly, not numbness either.  
Just a hollow kind of space inside that whispers, *“Something’s missing.”*

And I’ve noticed how quickly I try to fill it.

With noise.  
With tasks.  
With people.  
With food.  
With scrolling.  
With stories in my head about what’s wrong with me or what I need to fix.

But today, I didn’t try to fill it.  
I let it be there.

### 🌫️ A Space That’s Always Been There

The truth is — this emptiness has always lived inside me.  
It comes from all the places love didn’t reach.  
From all the times I needed someone and no one came.  
From all the moments I swallowed my needs just to keep the peace.  
From all the pretending that I was okay when I wasn’t.

And in that emptiness, I sometimes feel lonely.  
Not just alone, but *lonely* in the truest sense — like no one really sees me.

### 🪞 The Gift of Not Turning Away

But there’s also something tender here.  
Because when I stop running from the emptiness, I can actually hear what it’s saying.

It doesn’t want to be filled.  
It wants to be **witnessed**.

Not fixed. Not explained. Not healed in a rush.

Just held.  
Gently.  
Without judgment.

And in that stillness, there’s a strange kind of peace.

### 🔁 Not Forever, Just For Now

I know this isn’t forever.  
Emptiness is a visitor — not a life sentence.  
And sometimes what it’s really asking for is my own presence.

To sit with myself the way I wish someone had once sat with me.

No advice.  
No distraction.  
Just… *presence.*

So today, I gave myself that.  
And it was enough.

Not everything needs to be filled.  
Some spaces are sacred —  
And maybe this one is where the real connection begins.
