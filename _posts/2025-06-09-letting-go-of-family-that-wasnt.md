Sometimes clarity doesn’t come through big breakdowns or revelations.  
Sometimes it shows up in a quiet moment — like realising your uncle looked at you with subtle offence just because you didn’t echo his excitement about a car or a keepsake.

I wasn’t cruel. I wasn’t unkind.  
I was just **honest**.  
But in that family system, honesty is treated like a threat.  
Having a different opinion? It’s betrayal.  
Having boundaries? It’s rejection.  
Not performing warmth to fragile people? It’s a crime.

And I’m seeing now — it was always like that.

My uncle gave me cards once a year. He was present in fragments. But I think I clung to those fragments not because they were love — but because they were *something*. And when you grow up with so little, you mistake crumbs for a meal. You start convincing yourself that emotional coldness is just another version of affection.

But now, as an adult, I see it more clearly:  
That wasn’t love.  
That wasn’t safety.  
That wasn’t family.

> It was survival dressed up in politeness.  
> It was performance dressed up as connection.

I think he was shaped by the same brokenness that shaped my mum. I think he, too, didn’t get much love. But that doesn’t mean I have to stay in that legacy.

There’s still a part of me that wants to cling to the **idea** of family — to salvage something that feels like home. But what I’m finally starting to understand is:

> I don’t have one.  
> And that’s okay.

Because the grief is honest now.  
It’s not masked by hope.  
It’s not blurred by fantasy.  
It’s **mine**, and it’s grounded in truth.

I’m not walking away from something real.  
I’m just stopping the performance.  
And for the first time — that feels like peace.
