Some days I wake up and feel behind before the day even starts.

Behind on messages. Behind on goals. Behind on healing. Like I should already be further along, more put together, more *something*.

It’s a heavy feeling. A low-level hum of inadequacy that sneaks in quietly.

But I’m learning that these are the days I need softness the most.

Pushing harder doesn’t help. Beating myself up doesn’t create progress. It just deepens the feeling that I’m not enough.

So instead, I check in:
- Have I eaten?
- Have I moved my body?
- Have I connected with anything real?

That’s enough for today. Really. That’s enough.

Because often, what I call “falling behind” is actually just a sign that I’m overdue for gentleness.

And when I meet myself there, with presence instead of pressure, something begins to shift.

Maybe I’m not behind.  
Maybe I’m just human.
