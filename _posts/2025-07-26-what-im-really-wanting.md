Lately, I’ve been noticing a strong pull toward seeing a sex worker again.

But something feels different this time.  
The desire is still there—but it’s not as sharp, or impulsive, or even very sexual in the traditional sense.

I sat with it for a while and realised something quietly true:

> I don’t actually want sex.

At least not the way I used to frame it.

## What I Think I Want

Right now, I think I want:
- A massage  
- Maybe a blowjob  
- Nothing intense. No performance. No expectation to be “dominant” or “masculine” in the conventional way.

That surprised me.

Because as a man, there’s always been this unspoken pressure to want penetrative sex—like that’s the default setting.

But it isn’t. Not for me. Not right now.

## What I’m Actually Craving

When I sat with the urge, this is what I found underneath:

- To be touched without pressure  
- To feel attractive or wanted, even just momentarily  
- To receive softness, warmth, care  
- To *not have to do anything back*  
- To just exist and still be enough

It’s not about orgasm. It’s about *emotional co-regulation*.

I want to feel safe in my body again.

## What’s Tender Beneath It

The real need isn’t sexual. It’s *relational*.

- I’m tired.  
- I’ve carried too much alone.  
- I miss being close to someone without anxiety.  
- I miss connection that isn’t conditional.  
- I miss being wanted for who I am, not just for what I do.

There’s a part of me that still believes:
> “You’ll never be loved like that. This is as close as we’ll ever get. Take it while you can.”

That voice comes from the wounded child. And I don’t shame him for thinking that.

But another voice is growing now—the one that says:
> “Maybe you can have more.  
Maybe you already are creating more.  
Slowly. Softly. Honestly.”

## Final Thought

This isn’t about judging the urge.  
It’s about letting the urge speak *clearly*, so I don’t have to act on it blindly.

Whether I go or not, I’ll meet myself here again.  
Because this is where I’m really waiting to be held.
