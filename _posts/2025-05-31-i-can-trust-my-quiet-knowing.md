There’s a kind of knowing that doesn’t shout.

It’s not dramatic.  
It doesn’t demand attention.  
It’s just… there. Steady. Low hum in the background of my life.

It shows up when I slow down.  
When I step back from noise.  
When I stop asking everyone else what they think.

**That quiet knowing is mine—and I’m learning to trust it.**

It’s the feeling I get when something is off, even if I can’t explain why.  
It’s the peace that settles in when I make the right decision, even if others don’t understand.  
It’s the still voice inside that says, *“This way.”*

I used to second-guess it.  
Think I needed external proof.  
Think I wasn’t “qualified” to trust myself.

But I’ve lived enough, learned enough, and healed enough to know:

This inner guidance isn’t random.

It’s wisdom I’ve earned.

And I’m safe to follow it—even when the world tells me otherwise.
