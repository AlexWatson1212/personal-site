### The Compound Interest of Quiet Rejection

It’s not the big heartbreaks that wear me down the most.

It’s the accumulation of small unmet moments — the people who don’t respond, the playdates that fade into silence, the friends who stop initiating, the text messages left on read. None of them are dramatic. None of them justify anger. But each one leaves a mark. A question. A weight.

Over time, it adds up.  
Like emotional compound interest.  
Not loud. Just... constant.

And I start to wonder: *Is it me?*  
Is there something I’m missing? Something I’m doing wrong?  
Because surely if it happens this often, in this many areas, I must be the common denominator.

That’s the real ache.  
Not the rejection itself, but the slow erosion of self-trust that comes with it.

I’ve done the work.  
I’ve tried to be present, open, grounded.  
I don’t push. I don’t manipulate. I’m clear with my communication. I make space. I don’t chase.

And still — people disappear.  
Plans go unacknowledged.  
Connections that feel promising evaporate without a word.

It’s hard not to take it personally. Even when I know logically that it’s about them — their capacity, their lives, their discomfort with depth — it *feels* like it's about me. And the more it happens, the harder it gets to keep showing up.

I’ve reached a point where I’m not even sure what to do in social situations anymore.  
If I’m open, it’s misread.  
If I’m guarded, it’s misjudged.  
If I try to be consistent, I’m ignored.  
If I step back, I’m forgotten.

There’s no clear way to win in these spaces.  
Only this: a slow, quiet grief that says, *“You’re too much for the ones who never intended to meet you.”*

I’m not looking for praise. I’m not even looking for connection, really.  
I just want to feel like I belong in the world I’m living in.  
That the effort to be sincere isn't constantly met with absence.  
That when I make space for people, they won’t leave it empty.

But lately, it seems like they do. And it's lonely in a very specific way.

Still, I’ll keep showing up. Just a little quieter.  
A little more discerning.  
And a little more honest about how much this all costs.
