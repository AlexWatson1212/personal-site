I’ve been noticing something lately.

I don’t feel lonely. At least not in the way I used to. The ache, the restlessness, the sense that something vital was missing — it’s just… not there right now.

And it’s not because I’ve filled my life with people. I haven’t. It’s not because I’ve found some perfect relationship or finally cracked the code on connection.

It’s simpler than that.

I’m just enjoying my life.

There’s peace in my routines — walking the dog, sharing time with my son, focusing on my goals. There’s a quiet joy in the everyday. And the deeper truth is: I trust myself more than I ever have. I’m looking after myself in ways that I used to wish someone else would.

It’s like I’ve stopped waiting to be chosen. I’ve started choosing myself.

And here’s the liberating part: if I never find a partner, if I never fall madly in love again, if it’s just me and the life I’m building — that’s okay. More than okay. Because this life? It’s worth living.

I’m worthwhile.

And I’m even having a bit of fun.

That’s not something I would have said a year ago. Back then, everything felt like a waiting room. Like life was on pause until something or someone came along to make it feel complete.

Now, the completeness comes from within. It’s in the mornings I wake up and feel calm. It’s in the meals I cook for myself. It’s in the moments of reflection, the laughter with my son, the breath of fresh air on a solo walk.

I think this might be what healing feels like. Not some loud, triumphant breakthrough — but a soft settling into who I am. A quiet joy that doesn’t need to be proven.

And from this place? If someone comes into my life, they’ll be met with my wholeness, not my hope that they’ll fix what was broken.

Because I’m not broken.

**I’m free.**
