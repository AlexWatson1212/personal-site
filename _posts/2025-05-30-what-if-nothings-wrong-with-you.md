excerpt: "So much of healing begins with the radical question: what if I’m not broken, just deeply misunderstood — even by myself?"

What if the thing that’s been weighing you down isn’t a flaw… but a misunderstanding?

What if you’ve been trying to fix parts of yourself that were never broken — just wounded, unheard, or forced to adapt?

What if the anxiety you carry is intelligence without direction?  
What if your sadness is your body begging you to rest?  
What if your anger is a boundary that was crossed too many times?

> So slow to validate what we’ve lived through.

From a young age, many of us are taught to question our instincts. To be good instead of honest. To be quiet instead of curious. To cope instead of cry.

And so we grow up thinking something’s wrong with us:
- For being too sensitive.  
- For needing too much.  
- For pulling away.  
- For not bouncing back fast enough.

But what if your responses have been reasonable all along?  
What if your nervous system is just doing its best with what it learned?  
What if you’re not a problem to be solved — but a person to be understood?

Healing isn’t about fixing yourself into acceptability.  
It’s about softening toward the parts of you that never got what they needed.

You’re not too much. You’re not broken. You’re not failing.

You’re just human. And being human is messy — especially when you’re doing it consciously.

**What if there’s nothing wrong with you — and there never was? Imagine how differently you’d treat yourself. Now begin.**
