Something shifted today.

Not in my mind, but in my body.  
My body battery went up—not down. And it didn’t make any logical sense at first. I hadn’t done anything particularly relaxing. I hadn’t even gotten good news. In fact, I’m still sitting with the disappointment of not getting onto Level 4.

But then it clicked.  
For the first time in a long time, my body wasn’t preparing for battle.

No courses.  
No strain.  
No internal pressure to rush straight into the next proving ground.

Just space.  
Just breath.  
Just a quiet message from within: *“We’re not going back into the war.”*

Because that’s what it’s felt like—*a war of learning.* Not the content itself, but the **constant pressure** to hold everything together. To keep growing, improving, trying, surviving, achieving.

And now, there’s this one sacred year.  
Not to abandon the journey, but to let my body *reset*.  
To let my nervous system stop bracing.  
To let my whole being exhale, maybe for the first time in years.

That feels like healing.  
Not in theory.  
In practice.
