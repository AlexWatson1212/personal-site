I’ve always held on to connections that weren’t good for me — scraps that kept me from falling into the void. That same pattern shows up with places too. If I don’t push for something better, am I just tolerating because I don’t believe I deserve more? Or is it okay to stay where I am, because this is actually good enough?

### The Pressure of a New Life
Level 4 has given me a foundation. In the past, I don’t think I could have let go of scraps — it would have felt too dangerous, too empty. Now, I feel like I have enough stability to release what doesn’t serve me, whether that’s people or old roles. That’s a strength I didn’t have before.

### Neighbors and Boundaries
My neighborhood shows the spectrum of connection:
- Some have crossed boundaries (coming into my house unannounced, drinking while looking after my son). I’ve set limits, and I’m proud of that.
- Some are indifferent, offering only a wave or a smile.  
- Some show genuine appreciation, like when I took care of bins and parcels — not performative, just real gratitude. That landed differently.

It feels like I’m finally able to notice the *texture* of connection, not just label people as good or bad.

### The House Question
I ask myself: *Am I putting up with this house the same way I’ve put up with unhealthy relationships?*  
- On one hand, maybe I’m just tolerating because it’s what I feel I’m worth.  
- On the other hand, this house is stable, workable, and becoming something I can be proud of. I’m improving it, step by step.  

Moving would be disruptive to my son, and for now, it feels right to stay. Maybe in a couple of years, I’ll consider something detached. But even then, it won’t be about *escaping* — it will be about *choosing*.

### The Grounding Truth
Before, I stayed because I had no choice.  
Now, I stay because I can see the value, and I know I *could* choose differently later if I want.  

That’s not resignation. That’s agency. That’s worth.
