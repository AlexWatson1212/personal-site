I keep coming back to it.  
The same wound. The same grief. The same rage.

And I think that’s because I was never allowed to feel it. Not really.

I spent years trying to convince myself it wasn’t that bad — that my mother was just a bit difficult, or misunderstood, or trying her best. But the truth is, **she wasn’t a mother to me**. She was controlling, manipulative, cold, and emotionally dangerous.

I remember when I had my bathroom redone. I chose someone **I trusted** — my friend’s dad — because the person she recommended didn’t call back. But even then, she couldn’t stand it. She questioned his workmanship, nitpicked every detail, made me second-guess myself — when in reality, **he did a good job**. He was fair, honest, and reliable.

And now I see it for what it was.  
It wasn’t about tiles.  
It wasn’t about standards.  
It was about **control**.

Because I was making decisions without her.  
Because I was becoming **my own man**.  
And that terrified her.

I’ve realised something else, too — something harder to admit.

I think she liked it when I was unwell.  
When I was hospitalised, psychotic, sedated — I was easier to manage. Easier to manipulate. Easier to keep under her thumb.

That is not love. That is **possession**.

She didn’t want children. She admitted that, laughed it off like it was funny. Like my very existence was a joke. And yet, somehow, she still thinks she’s entitled to my time, my energy, my loyalty — **after everything**.

She’s not.

Every time I revisit this, I feel the hate rise up again.  
And yeah — I hate her.  
That’s just the truth of it.

It’s not graceful. It’s not poetic.  
But it’s **honest**.

I spent decades trying to protect her image — in my mind, in the world, even in my own healing. But the more I see her clearly, the more I understand just how damaging she was. How much of my soul she tried to own. How many parts of myself I had to bury just to survive.

And now?  
I’m angry.  
I’m *done*.  
And I don’t need to censor that anymore.

---

Letting this out isn’t staying stuck. It’s **releasing**.  
It’s unhooking myself from the shame and the silence.  
It’s saying:

> “I didn’t deserve that. I was never the problem. She was.”

And if I circle back to this again, that’s okay.  
Because it wasn’t one wound — it was *a thousand small cuts over decades*.

This is me healing.  
This is me reclaiming.

And this is me saying — finally —  
**Fuck her.**
