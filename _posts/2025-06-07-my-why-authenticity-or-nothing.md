description: I don’t need a grand mission. I just need to be myself. Fully, honestly. Because the alternative is too costly — to me, and to the world.
emotions: [grief, acceptance]

Sometimes I wonder why I do any of this.

The writing.  
The healing.  
The inner work.  
The stillness.

It’s not to impress anyone.  
It’s not for success.  
It’s because I’ve lived the alternative — and it nearly broke me.

---

**My why is simple:**  
To be the best version of myself —  
not for praise, not for power —  
but to *reduce unnecessary suffering*.  
Mine. Others'. The world’s.

And I’ve seen how that happens:  
Not by fixing everyone else.  
But by *being myself*.  
Fully. Openly. Gratefully.

Because when I do that —  
when I live in truth —  
I give others permission to do the same.  
That’s how the light spreads.  
Not by force. By presence.

**Authenticity isn’t a trend for me. It’s survival.**  
The false self?  
That mask I used to wear just to be liked or safe or good enough?  
It cost me everything.

It made me sick.  
It silenced me.  
It disconnected me from my body, my soul, my purpose.

And so now, authenticity is my only option.  
Not because I’ve mastered it,  
but because I’ve tasted the emptiness of living without it.

---

I don’t need a perfect life.  
I need a *true* one.

One rooted in meaning.  
One where service flows from gratitude, not obligation.  
One where I show up, again and again —  
imperfect, but real.

Because that’s what heals.  
And that’s what lasts.
