There’s a sharpness to disgust.

It feels righteous. Final. Like we’re above whatever — or whoever — triggered it.

But sometimes… that disgust isn’t what we think it is.

Sometimes it’s **jealousy** in a clever costume.

We see someone being loud, confident, playful, free — and we feel it in our gut.  
“Ugh, who *does* she think she is?”  
“Why’s *he* so full of himself?”  

It feels like judgment, but deep down, it might be something else.

> It might be a part of us whispering, “I wish I could do that.”

When we’ve been shamed or punished for self-expression, joy, boldness, or even just *taking up space*, we can grow to resent those qualities in others. Not because they’re wrong — but because they remind us of something we’ve buried in ourselves.

Disgust is sharp. Jealousy is vulnerable.

It’s easier to roll our eyes than admit we *want* something. Especially if we believe we don’t deserve it — or that it’s “not for people like us.”

But healing means softening that disgust. Getting curious. Asking:

- What is it about this person that gets under my skin?  
- What are they expressing that I’ve been taught to suppress?  
- Is there a version of me that longs to be more like that?

Sometimes the people we judge are mirrors — reflecting the parts of us we’re scared to reclaim.

And when we can name that with honesty, the judgment loosens.  
The jealousy softens.  
The healing begins.
