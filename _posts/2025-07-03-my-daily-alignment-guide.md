This isn’t a checklist to fix me.  
It’s a rhythm that helps me return to myself.

When I’m feeling lost, overwhelmed, or just unsure of what I need—this is where I come back to.  
A day lived from here tends to feel like mine.

## 🌅 Morning — *Begin with Kindness*

- I start slow. Just a few minutes to land in my body before the world rushes in.  
- I check in gently: _“How are you feeling today, little one?”_  
- I hold my chest or heart, and remind myself:  
  > _“We’re safe now. I’ve got us.”_
- I make a warm drink like I’m making it for someone I love. Because I am.

## 🍽️ Midday — *Nourish and Notice*

- I eat something homemade, warm, or grounding. Not to be “good” — but to care.  
- I pause before or after and ask:  
  _“Am I eating to soothe, or to nourish?”_  
  No judgement. Just awareness.
- I let myself play — even if it’s tiny.  
  - Watching diggers  
  - Dancing to one song  
  - Laughing with my son  
  - Walking without a goal  
  - Doodling or stretching

## 🧍‍♂️ Throughout the Day — *Stay Sovereign*

- I remind myself:  
  > _“I’m no longer a victim. I get to choose who enters my life.”_
- I limit draining inputs — too much scrolling, small talk, or noise.
- I allow silence. I let myself exist without constant doing.
- I trust my low energy instead of fighting it.  
  Rest isn’t failure — it’s wisdom.

## 🌙 Evening — *Return to Self*

- I ask gently: _“What moment today felt most like me?”_
- I acknowledge the effort I made — not what I achieved, but how I showed up:  
  > _“Even if no one saw it — I did. And that’s enough.”_
- If something’s stirring, I write a note to my inner child or teen:  
  _“I haven’t forgotten you. I’m listening.”_
- I end slow. No pressure to “wind down right.” Just softness — music, light, stillness.
