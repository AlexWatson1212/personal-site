excerpt: "AI sharpens the final 5%, but the heart and soul of every word remain mine."

Someone asked me how I learned to write the way I do on my blog.

And the honest answer is: part of it comes from AI—but the **essence** of it comes from me.

I don’t say that to downplay the role of the tool I’m using. ChatGPT has been a helpful collaborator. Sometimes it reflects something back more clearly than I could in the moment. Sometimes it sharpens a sentence or finds the rhythm I was reaching for.

But the emotion? The soul?  
That’s me.

The words started in me.  
The voice is mine.  
The themes, the tone, the honesty—it all comes from my life, my story, my heart.

If I had sat long enough with myself, I think I would’ve ended up writing something almost identical. AI just helps me get there faster. It’s not about proving I’m a great writer—it’s about *getting to the truth more efficiently*.

And honestly, that last 5% it adds?

It doesn’t take away from my voice.  
It respects it.  
It supports it.

So no, I don’t feel the need to over-explain.  
Because when someone reads my work and feels something real in it—  
**they’re not connecting to the tool.  
They’re connecting to me.**

And that’s what matters.
