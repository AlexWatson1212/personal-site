My mind can be loud.

It tells stories. It repeats old fears. It brings up worst-case scenarios, sometimes out of nowhere.

And for a long time, I believed every word.

But now, I pause.  
I question.  
I remind myself:

**Not every thought is the truth.**

Some thoughts are echoes of the past.  
Some are protective patterns.  
Some are just noise—temporary weather passing through.

I don’t have to push them away.  
But I also don’t have to let them drive the car.

I can notice them, name them, and choose a different response.

I can ask:  
> “Is this thought kind?”  
> “Is it true?”  
> “Is it helpful?”

If the answer is no, I can let it go.

Because my thoughts are part of me, yes.

But they don’t define me.

I do.
