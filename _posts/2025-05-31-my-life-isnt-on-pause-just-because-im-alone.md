There were seasons where being alone felt like waiting.

Waiting for someone to arrive.  
Waiting for life to feel full.  
Waiting for the moment I’d finally be chosen.

But over time, I’ve realised something really important:

**My life isn’t on pause just because I’m alone.**

This isn’t the in-between.  
This *is* the life.  
And it’s meaningful, even without a romantic subplot.

I’m building things.  
I’m getting to know myself in ways I never could when I was constantly focused on someone else.  
I’m learning what lights me up—and what drains me.  
I’m discovering how to enjoy a day on my own terms.

This isn’t waiting.  
It’s living.

And when love comes, if it comes, I won’t be starting life then.

I’ll just be adding to it.

That’s a very different energy—and it’s the one I trust now.
