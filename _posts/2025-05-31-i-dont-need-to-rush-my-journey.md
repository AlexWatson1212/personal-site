There’s a part of me that gets impatient.

I want the healing to be done.  
The answers to be clear.  
The next chapter to finally begin.

But when I look back, I can see something clearly:

**The most important shifts in my life didn’t happen overnight.**

They happened in the pauses.  
In the quiet efforts no one saw.  
In the seasons where it felt like nothing was changing—but *everything* was growing beneath the surface.

So I’m learning to honour the pace I’m at.

To stop forcing clarity.  
To stop comparing timelines.  
To stop sprinting through something that deserves to be felt.

I’m not behind.

I’m not late.

I’m exactly where I need to be—even if it’s slower than I expected.

This is *my* pace.  
This is *my* journey.

And I’ll walk it with patience, presence, and trust.
