I feel bloated. I feel overweight. I feel like I let myself down in a way. But it's nowhere near as strong as it has been in the past.

It's like I'm a different person when I'm dysregulated late at night — and I'm learning to meet that version of myself with compassion instead of criticism. To simply say, *"Mate, you're trying your best, but you need sleep."*

That *is* the repairing. That’s the real work.

I can’t always stop it from happening. But I *can* control how much it affects my life. I’m not aiming to be perfect. I’m learning to re-regulate. To trust myself again. To love myself, even when it’s hard.

And I know that when I’ve built that kind of secure base inside, welcoming others — a partner, friends, support — will come more naturally. Because then, I’ll *know* I have something good to offer. Not just on the days I feel calm and grounded… but also on the days I don’t.

That’s not immaturity. If anything, it might be the most mature thing I’ve ever learned.

I feel like I’m very close to being able to welcome people into my life with open arms — and in a very safe way.

And yeah… we’ll see what happens.
