For a long time, I felt like I had to explain my boundaries.

I’d over-justify why I couldn’t meet up.  
I’d soften my “no” with layers of apology.  
I’d turn a simple request into a full emotional essay—just to make sure no one got upset.

But I’ve learned something that changed everything:

**I don’t owe anyone an explanation for protecting my peace.**

A boundary isn’t rude.  
It’s not cold.  
It’s not a rejection of someone else—it’s a commitment to myself.

I can say:
> “This doesn’t work for me.”  
> “I need more space.”  
> “I’m not available for that.”

And leave it there.

The people who respect me won’t need a PowerPoint presentation.  
They’ll just listen—and adjust.

And the ones who don’t?

Well… that’s information too.

I trust myself to decide what I allow in my life.  
And that trust doesn’t need a disclaimer.
