I recently found myself watching a video by Leo Skepi called *“How to Stop Being Weak.”* What struck me wasn’t the title—it was him. His presence. His mix of energy. 

Here was a man who didn’t fit any one box:  
- Fiercely masculine, yet openly gay.  
- Confident, yet vulnerable.  
- Authentic, without the pressure to appear perfect.

He spoke with conviction. But more than that, he spoke from his *own* life—not from a pedestal. He didn’t claim to be a therapist. He didn’t claim to have it all together. He’s given up cocaine recently, but still drinks and smokes. He’s open about that. And in doing so, he becomes *relatable*—not despite his flaws, but because of them.

It made me reflect on my own journey. I’ve spent so long thinking:
> *“Who am I to write, to help, to share anything—when I’m still in it?”*

I thought I needed to be more refined. More healed. More credible. That I had to earn my place in the world of helping others by becoming a version of myself that was already complete.

But Leo reminded me:  
**Presence is more powerful than perfection.**

It’s not about being “done.”  
It’s about being *honest*.

People don’t need another sanitized role model. They need someone real enough to say:
> *“Yeah, I’m still figuring it out—but I’m here, and I’m not hiding.”*

There’s something sacred about that. Especially for men. Especially in a world that tells us we need to choose between being strong or soft, bold or broken, masculine or tender.

Leo Skepi doesn’t choose. He holds both.  
And maybe that’s what true wholeness is.

So today, I’m done waiting to be perfect.  
I’ll share as I go. I’ll create while still healing.  
I’ll speak not because I have answers, but because I have *truth*.

And that’s more than enough.
