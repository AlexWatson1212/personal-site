There was a time I turned everything into self-work.

A bad mood? What wound is this linked to?  
A craving? What am I avoiding?  
A mistake? Time to dissect it and rewrite the narrative.

And while that kind of awareness helped me heal… it also became exhausting.

Because I forgot how to just *be*.

I forgot that I don’t have to mine every moment for meaning.  
That I don’t need to optimise, improve, or explain everything I do.  
That some days are just days. Some thoughts don’t need unpacking. Some habits don’t need fixing right now.

Sometimes I’m just tired. Or grumpy. Or a little unmotivated.  
That doesn’t mean I’m broken. It means I’m *alive*.

So now, I’m learning to rest inside myself—not always *work* on myself.

There’s nothing to prove. Not even to me.
