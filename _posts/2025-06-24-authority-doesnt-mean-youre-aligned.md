Title: Authority Doesn’t Mean You’re Aligned
Date: 2025-06-24
Tags: power-dynamics, projection, boundaries
Description: Just because someone holds a position of authority doesn’t mean they’re more evolved — or entitled to treat you like a student of your own life.
Emotions: [anger, acceptance]

I used to think I had an issue with women in authority.

That something in me bristled when they spoke, corrected, directed.  
That maybe it was some deep mother wound I hadn’t healed yet.  
But that wasn’t it.

It wasn’t about women.  
And it wasn’t about authority.

It was about people — *anyone* — who step into a role of assumed superiority.  
Who confuse their job title with spiritual alignment.  
Who believe that because they’re the *tutor*, they’re also the *teacher of me*.

Yes, you might be guiding a group.  
Yes, you might be older, more experienced in the field.  
But you don’t get to parent me.

You don’t get to psychoanalyse me without consent.  
You don’t get to pull something I shared in vulnerability six months ago and use it as a public lesson.  
You don’t get to suggest I “have work to do” — as if you know the terrain I’ve walked.

Because truth is, I’ve probably done more inner work than you.  
Not in theory — in blood. In silence. In nights I didn’t think I’d survive.

And maybe that threatens you.

Maybe it’s easier to project down than meet me level.

But let me be clear:

I’m not your student in the school of self.  
I’m not a blank slate waiting to be shaped.  
I’m not looking for a parent — I’m looking for mutuality.

If you can’t offer that, I’ll find the door.  
Not as rebellion.  
Not as ego.

But as respect — for myself.

Because power doesn’t make you wise.  
And authority doesn’t mean you’re aligned.
