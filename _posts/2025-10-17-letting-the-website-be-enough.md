I’ve completed the website. It’s not perfect, but it feels *good enough* as it is. I thought I might always want to refine and polish it, but what I’m noticing is that its true value has already shown itself: it served a deep creative need for me. That alone makes it worthwhile.  

This site holds my beliefs, my self-expression, what feels true to me right now. Maybe those things aren’t universal truths, but they help me discover myself. That was always the real aim.  

Part of me still hopes it might also become a gift for others. I’d love for it to support people alongside therapy, because unless we’re willing to look inward, therapy can only go so far. Maybe this site will one day hold truths or tools that help others discover who they are. Or maybe it won’t—and that’s okay too.  

Interestingly, the anxiety I used to carry about people reading my words has all but gone. Perhaps it’s because I know very few people will stumble across it, but I actually like that. If it comes up in college, I’d feel comfortable sharing it. I already speak honestly in therapy sessions with my peers, so this would just be an extension of that truth.  

In fact, sharing it at college could be healing. It would let me receive feedback on how useful it might be and what could be improved. And the best part is, it doesn’t have to be all me. I’ve loved creating it, but if others wanted to help refine it, I’d be open. For now, I simply enjoy that it exists. That feels like enough.
