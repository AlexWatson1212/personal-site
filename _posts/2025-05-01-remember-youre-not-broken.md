There’s a quiet lie that so many of us carry.

That we’re broken. Flawed beyond repair. That if people knew the real us — the messy, anxious, tired, too-much or not-enough version — they’d turn away.

But here’s the truth:

**You’re not broken.**

You’ve been wounded, sure. Shaped by pain. Molded by expectations that were never truly yours. But underneath all that?

You’re whole. Always were.

Sometimes healing isn’t about fixing anything. It’s about *unlearning* — letting go of the beliefs, patterns, and roles you had to adopt just to survive.

> Healing is remembering who you were before the world taught you to be small.

This journey you're on — it’s not a self-improvement project. It’s a **self-reclamation**.

It’s okay to grieve the time you spent thinking you were broken. To mourn the energy spent trying to be “better” when you were already enough.

And it’s also okay to feel resistance when you read this. That voice that says “yeah, but not me.” I know that voice. I carried it for years.

But I promise you — you are not beyond repair. Because you were never shattered in the first place.

You are *becoming* again.

More yourself.

More free.

More whole.

And that’s not because you’ve fixed everything — it’s because you finally stopped believing you were broken in the first place.

**You’re not broken. You’re remembering. And that’s more than enough.**
