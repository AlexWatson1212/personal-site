I’ve learned a lot about emotional regulation.

I’ve practiced breathing through discomfort, noticing triggers, sitting with sadness, and offering myself compassion. And honestly, it’s helped.

But sometimes… I still lose it.

I spiral. I overthink. I react. I reach out when I said I wouldn’t. I replay a hand or a message for too long. And then another voice shows up:

> “You should be better than this by now.”

That voice tries to turn growth into performance. Like healing is only valid if I never falter again.

But here’s the truth: **My worth isn’t determined by how well I regulate.**

It’s okay to have messy moments. They don’t undo my progress. They don’t mean I’ve failed. They just mean I’m human.

And ironically, the fastest way back to balance…  
is to stop punishing myself for losing it in the first place.

Growth isn’t about never slipping.  
It’s about how gently I respond when I do.
