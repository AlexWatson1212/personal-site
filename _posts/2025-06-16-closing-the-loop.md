Some messages aren’t sent to get anything back — just to honour the part someone played in your becoming.

I messaged my old therapist the other day. Just a simple thank you. Nothing dramatic. No backstory. Just… a moment of clarity, and the need to name something I hadn’t said before.

Because the truth is, he helped me more than I realised at the time.  
He helped me stay steady when I wanted to cut ties with my mother — not by talking me out of it, but by slowing me down.  
By reminding me not to throw the baby out with the bathwater.  
Not because the “baby” was her — but because *I was*.

At the time, I didn’t quite understand what he meant.  
But now I think I do.

He wasn’t protecting her.  
He was giving *me* the space to step into my power — slowly, carefully, with dignity.  
He saw that the dynamic had shifted in my favour, even if I couldn’t see it yet.  
And he trusted that I’d know what to do when the moment came.

I think he knew this would happen.  
That she would make one last move.  
That I wouldn’t bite.  
That I’d walk away *free* — not bitter.  
And that when I did, I might one day write to say: *thank you.*

And so I did.

I wasn’t looking for anything.  
Just wanted to close the loop. To honour the space we shared. To acknowledge the part he played in helping me become who I am now.

He replied:

> *“I feel very privileged to have played some part in your growth. Good luck with everything.”*

That was it. And that was enough.

Because sometimes closure doesn’t come with fireworks.  
Sometimes it’s just a quiet message sent from a place of peace.

And when you no longer need a reply — that’s when you know you’ve truly moved on.
