Sometimes emotional unavailability is obvious — cold, dismissive, distant.  
But other times, it’s subtle.  
It hides in polite smiles, scattered attention, or someone being just emotionally present *enough* to keep you engaged, but not enough to truly meet you.

And that’s where things get confusing.

Because today, I don’t think I was with someone completely shut down.  
She wasn’t cruel or detached. She wasn’t trying to hurt me.  
But she wasn’t really *there* either — not in the way I needed.  
And I felt it… somewhere.

Not in a thought. Not even in a feeling.  
But in my body — in the fatigue that came afterward, in the slow sense of collapse.  
It wasn’t until much later that I wondered:  
> *“Was she just not emotionally available enough for me?”*

And maybe that’s the truth.

Maybe I didn’t walk away questioning my worth, but my body did the math.  
It picked up on the lack of resonance, the tiny disconnections, the quiet absence behind her eyes.  
And it said: *“This isn’t it.”*

Not with drama.  
Just with stillness.  
With exhaustion.

And I think that’s the hardest kind of disconnection to name — when someone isn’t toxic, but they’re not able to offer the depth or presence you long for.  
It’s not abuse. It’s *almost*.  
Almost seen. Almost met. Almost safe.

But my body knows the difference.  
It always has.

And that’s what I’m learning to trust now — not just my thoughts, not even my heart — but the quiet messages in my nervous system.

Because after being around someone who’s truly available, I don’t collapse.  
I don’t second-guess myself.  
I don’t feel invisible.

I feel *more* like myself. Not less.

So maybe emotional availability isn’t a checklist.  
Maybe it’s a felt sense.  
A quiet knowing.  
A warmth that stays, even after the conversation ends.

And the more I listen to my body, the clearer that knowing becomes.
