Title: The Symptoms Are the Soul Speaking
Date: 2025-06-24
Tags: james-hollis, somatic-awareness, inner-work
Description: Chapter 21 of *Living an Examined Life* reminds us that symptoms — anxiety, exhaustion, compulsions — are not just problems to fix, but messages from the soul that something deeper needs attention.
Emotions: [grief, acceptance]

What if your exhaustion isn’t weakness?  
What if the cake cravings, the late-night spirals, the tension in your chest — aren’t failures, but *messages*?

In Chapter 21 of *Living an Examined Life*, Hollis invites us to stop seeing symptoms as things to eliminate — and start listening to them as signals from the soul.

> “The symptom is the psyche’s way of alerting us that something is out of alignment.”  
> — James Hollis

So often I try to *power through*:
- Eat better.  
- Sleep earlier.  
- Stop the scrolling.  
- Push away the loneliness.

But what if those very symptoms are my soul saying:  
> *“Please don’t abandon me. Something here needs your attention.”*

Hollis says the psyche will find a way to speak — even if it has to do it through discomfort.

That means:
- Anxiety isn’t just stress — it’s often a sign I’m betraying some deeper truth.  
- Overeating might be grief that hasn’t found language.  
- Fatigue could be the body’s protest against a life that’s out of sync.

Instead of asking “How do I fix this?” — I’m learning to ask:  
**“What is this trying to tell me?”**

This changes everything.

It turns self-care from a chore into a conversation.  
It turns shame into curiosity.  
It turns symptoms into sacred messengers.

So I’m listening now — not trying to silence or override.  
And in that listening, I’m building a life that doesn’t need symptoms to speak for me.

I’m learning the language of my soul.  
And I’m finally ready to hear it.
