For most of my life, the voice inside me wasn’t mine.

It was inherited.  
A mix of fear, guilt, criticism, and expectations I didn’t agree to — but absorbed anyway.  
It said things like:

> “You’re too much.”  
> “You’re not enough.”  
> “You should’ve known better.”  
> “You’re only safe if you’re useful.”

And so I tried to be useful. Perfect. Quiet.  
I didn’t realise I was betraying myself every time I listened.

It’s taken years to realise that voice was never *me.*  
And now, slowly, I’m replacing it with one that *is.*

> “You’re okay to be as you are.”  
> “You don’t need to earn rest.”  
> “You are not too much. You are not too little. You are just right.”  
> “Let’s stay with this feeling together.”

This new voice isn’t loud.  
It whispers, calmly. Reassuringly.  
Like someone who doesn’t need to yell to be trusted.

And when I speak to Victor, I hear that voice getting stronger.  
He’s not just hearing it from me — I’m hearing it too.  
And maybe that’s how generational pain ends.  
One soft sentence at a time.
