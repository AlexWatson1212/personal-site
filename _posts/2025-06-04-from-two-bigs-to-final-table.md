At one point, I was down to two big blinds.  
Maybe even one.

In most tournaments, that’s the point where people shove anything remotely playable and hope for the best. But something in me was steady. I didn’t panic. I didn’t chase. I just waited — watched — trusted the process.

And somehow, I ended up first in chips.  
Not through luck. Not through a heater.  
Through patience. Timing. Observation.  
And maybe, most of all, **growth**.

I’m at the final table now, sitting in third place.  
No matter where I finish, this run has already taught me something important:  
> *There’s immense value in stillness. In knowing your spot. In choosing not to flinch when others do.*

It’s also a testament to the work I’ve done.  
Reviewing hands. Questioning spots. Not outsourcing my decisions.  
I haven’t needed to ask for advice this session — not because I’m above it, but because I’ve internalised the patterns. I *know* my plays are good.

That’s a quiet kind of confidence.  
Not loud. Not arrogant. Just grounded.

I used to feel like poker was chaotic — full of swings I couldn’t control.  
But today, I feel calm in the middle of it.  
I’m seeing more clearly. I’m acting more intentionally.  
And I’m trusting myself more than ever.

That, to me, is the real prize — win or lose.
