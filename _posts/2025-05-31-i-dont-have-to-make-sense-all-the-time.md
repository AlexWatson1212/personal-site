There are days when I feel off and I don’t know why.

No obvious trigger. No big reason. Just a heaviness. A fog. A low hum of sadness or restlessness or tension that I can’t put words to.

And in the past, I’d rush to figure it out.  
> “What’s wrong with me?”  
> “Why am I feeling this way?”  
> “I need to solve this right now.”

But lately, I’m learning to let it be.

**I don’t have to make sense all the time.**

I’m allowed to feel what I feel, even if I don’t have a perfect explanation.  
I’m allowed to rest inside uncertainty.  
I’m allowed to trust that understanding might come later—or not at all.

What matters most is that I stay with myself.

No fixing. No forcing. Just presence.

Because sometimes, being with what’s real is more healing than trying to make it tidy.
