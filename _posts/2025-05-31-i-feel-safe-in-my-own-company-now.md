There was a time when being alone felt like a punishment.

Silence felt heavy. Stillness felt empty. I’d reach for anything—my phone, a message, someone to distract me—just to escape myself.

But now? I feel safe in my own company.

Not because I’ve figured everything out. Not because I’m always content. But because I’m no longer scared of my own presence.

I can sit on the sofa, drink tea, hear the hum of the world around me—and feel calm. I can have a quiet evening without needing to fill it. I can feel things deeply without needing someone else to fix or witness them.

This didn’t happen overnight. It came from showing up again and again. From listening without judgement. From realising that peace wasn’t out there—it was something I could build inside.

I don’t need constant connection to feel whole anymore.

I just need this moment.

And in this moment, I’m okay.

Sometimes, I’m even more than okay—I’m *home*.
