I might just go home and make a potato curry, even though I’ve got so much food in the freezer that I could just heat up. That’s the thing — I don’t *have* to cook. But part of me wants to. Maybe because it grounds me. Maybe because it reminds me I’m worth the effort.

Even though it doesn’t always feel like it, I’m really taking care of myself at the moment. The house is cleaner. The food’s prepped. I’m thinking ahead and slowly making decisions that reflect the man I’m becoming, not the version of me stuck in survival.

There are moments of loneliness — and they still sting sometimes — but overall, life just keeps improving. Quietly. Subtly. And I think that’s enough for now.

The only thing missing is the kind of connection I’m after. Real, mutual, present connection. And even though a part of me doubts it’ll come, deep down I think it’s inevitable. I just don’t know when.

But that’s okay. I can hold that uncertainty and still choose to care for myself today. Even if it’s something as small as cooking a curry I don’t *need* to make. Maybe that’s the kind of life I want — one where I do things not out of necessity, but out of love.

**Question to reflect on:**  
What’s one small act of care I’ve done lately — not because I had to, but because I *wanted* to?
