Today brought both connection and challenge.  

On one hand, I felt more part of the group than before. That sense of belonging nourishes me, and it helps me feel safer in the learning environment.  

On the other hand, my patterns surfaced. When complimented by my tutor, I responded with humour — not harmful, but more like a shield. It leaves me wondering whether I’m sometimes deflecting genuine connection with humour.  

In working groups, I felt triggered. The task wasn’t hard, but the dynamics echoed past experiences with my mother. Frustration and impatience rose, not because of the group itself, but because of what it stirred in me.  

Even with those challenges, I see progress: I’m noticing my triggers, reflecting on them, and still feeling more integrated into the group overall. That mix of difficulty and belonging shows me I’m growing, even when it feels uncomfortable.
