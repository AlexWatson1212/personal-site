There’s a particular kind of missing that doesn’t come from romance or intensity — it comes from **safety**. From the quiet relief of being around someone who doesn’t drain you, demand you, or disregard you. Someone who simply lets you be.

I recently realised I miss someone like that.

She was a classmate. Not someone I knew deeply, but enough to feel something shift in me when we spoke. I told her I genuinely liked her — not in a dramatic, romantic way — but because being around her felt *safe*. I didn’t have to perform or protect myself. And in a world where emotional safety feels rare, that meant more than I even knew at the time.

It wasn’t even about sexual attraction, really. I just noticed I felt calm. Steady. That box — the one labelled *“feel safe in someone’s presence”* — got ticked in a way I hadn’t experienced in years.

And now that she’s not around, I miss her. But I also realise I might just be missing the **feeling**. The feeling of being seen without scrutiny. Of not having to scan for threat. Of simply existing next to someone and knowing I’m okay as I am.

And that’s a powerful thing to notice — not to cling to a person, but to honour the *quality of connection* they gave me a glimpse of.

I’ve also started noticing a similar pull with someone else — a man I felt drawn to. But that dynamic felt slightly different, more complex. I wonder if he’s a bit avoidant. And I wonder if some old pattern in me wanted to prove I was worthy of his attention. Still, he felt emotionally safe enough at times to show me something important: I’m not seeking perfection. I’m seeking connection that doesn’t hurt.

What all of this has shown me is that I’m changing. Therapy has taught me to *feel* emotional safety in my body, not just think it. And now, I know what to look for. I know what to protect. And I know that even if those particular people are no longer in my life, the **capacity for that kind of connection is alive in me**.

That gives me hope. And it gives me direction.
