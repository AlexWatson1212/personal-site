description: The five values that keep me grounded — not as a checklist to perfect, but as a compass to return to when life feels unclear.
emotions: [acceptance, growth]

When everything gets loud —  
when I feel pulled in different directions,  
when I lose sight of what actually matters —  
I come back to this.

A quiet list.  
A compass.  
Not goals, not achievements —  
just things that keep me *me*.

---

**1. Authenticity**  
I’m tired of playing roles.  
I want to show up real — not for applause, not for acceptance,  
but because pretending costs too much.  
Authenticity doesn’t mean I’m always confident.  
It means I’m honest.  
It means I’m in integrity, even when it’s uncomfortable.

---

**2. Health**  
Not a number. Not a six-pack.  
Just a body that feels good to live in.  
That can move, breathe, rest, play.  
I want energy. I want to feel light in my skin.  
Strong enough to carry what life asks of me —  
physically, emotionally, spiritually.

---

**3. Connection**  
Real connection.  
The kind where I don’t have to shrink or perform.  
Where being myself is enough.  
Where silence isn’t awkward.  
Where I feel met, seen, held.  
I don’t need many — just a few that feel true.

---

**4. Freedom**  
Not chaos. Not rebellion.  
But space.  
Space to live by my own values.  
To build a life that reflects what matters to me.  
To say no when something costs my peace.  
To choose how I spend my time, and with whom.

---

**5. Kaizen**  
The quiet commitment to growth.  
Not for productivity.  
But because becoming a little more *me* each day feels sacred.  
It’s the smallest shifts —  
the gentle habits, the honest reflections,  
the courage to keep going, even when no one’s watching.

---

These five keep me steady.  
They’re not something to perfect.  
They’re something to return to  
when I forget who I am.

And I *will* forget sometimes.  
That’s okay.

Because remembering is part of the journey.
