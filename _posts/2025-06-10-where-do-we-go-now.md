> ðŸŽµ *"Where do we go now?"*  
> â€” *Sweet Child oâ€™ Mine*, Guns N' Roses

That lyric came into my head today, and it honestly fits.  
Because I donâ€™t quite know where Iâ€™m going next.  
But for once, Iâ€™m not afraid of that question.

Itâ€™s not a panicâ€”itâ€™s a pulse.  
A sign that Iâ€™m in transition.  
And this time, Iâ€™m grounded in something real:  
**Me.**

Sure, in theory things could get worse.  
But realistically?  
I know myself better now.  
I can feel my emotions instead of suppressing them.  
I can sit with them instead of hiding.  
And Iâ€™ve seen what happens when I live honestlyâ€”I attract others who live the same.

Thatâ€™s more than enough to build on.

I think I sometimes forget how many people *do* care.  
People who show up, who hold space.  
Like my manager from Bernardoâ€™s Childrenâ€™s Charity.  
Sheâ€™s been a quiet force of good in my life.  
Supportive in a way I didnâ€™t realise I needed.  
Not performativeâ€”just real.

And I think thatâ€™s what I was looking for all along.  
Not just to help others, but to heal something in myself.  
And thatâ€™s not selfish.  
> *Thatâ€™s what real giving looks likeâ€”when healing yourself helps others heal too.*

That last line landed deeply in my chest.  
It came from somewhere deeper than logic.  
Thatâ€™s when I know itâ€™s the truth.

And maybe for the first time, I donâ€™t feel alone.

Because Iâ€™ve got *me* now.  
And yeah, that might sound clichÃ©â€”but itâ€™s honest.

I donâ€™t fear being alone.  
I fear being around people who make me feel alone.

People like Will.  
Connor.  
The guy in Chile. The guy in Australia.  
My mum. My sister.  
Some neighbours.  
Different names, same pattern:  
> *They lacked the emotional depth I need to feel seen.*

And when Iâ€™m with people like that, I start questioning myself.  
*Am I too much? Am I not enough?*

But I know nowâ€”thatâ€™s just fear.  
False evidence appearing real.

---

So Iâ€™m making space.  
Clearing out what was never a match, so what is can finally arrive.  
Iâ€™m letting go of the echo chambers of my past.

And Iâ€™m opening to something better.  
Not louder. Not flashier. Just... deeper.  
Kinder. Truer. Present.

Because I deserve that.  
And Iâ€™m no longer settling for anything less.

---

So where do I go now?

I donâ€™t know.  
But I do know this:  
> Iâ€™m not going back.
