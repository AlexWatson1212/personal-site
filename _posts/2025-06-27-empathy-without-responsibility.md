I’ve spent most of my life reading people — deeply.  
I can sense what they’re hiding. I can feel the unspoken shame, the inner child wounds, the desperation to be seen. And for a long time, I responded to that by softening myself.  
By making space.  
By empathising so hard I let my boundaries melt.

But I’m not doing that anymore.

Take my neighbour, for example.  
He walks back inside when I appear — like my presence exposes something he doesn’t want to see. And I get it. I really do.  
He’s the youngest of ten. Probably felt overlooked his whole life. Probably never got to be the strong one, the respected one, the man of his own house.  

But I’m not here to soothe his past.

When I walk past him now, I hold my ground.  
Not with aggression — but with calm. With presence. With the kind of energy that says:
> *“I’m not afraid of your discomfort. And I’m no longer sacrificing mine.”*

### Empathy without responsibility.

That’s the lesson I’m learning.  
It’s not about becoming hard or cold.  
It’s about saying: *“I see your pain — but I don’t need to make myself small to soothe it.”*

I used to confuse understanding someone with needing to save them.  
I used to think that if I could feel their wound, I had a duty to hold it.  
But the truth is: **I can witness without carrying. I can care without fixing.**

And when people start testing my boundaries — it’s not because I’ve done something wrong.  
It’s because they’re not used to someone standing in truth without crumbling.

There’s a part of me that sometimes wonders why I’m writing all this.  
These blogs — these pages — they don’t get seen by many.  
They don’t always get to “marinate.”  
Some posts feel more impactful than others, and I don’t know if anyone will read them at all.

But that’s okay.  
Because **this is healing me**. And that’s reason enough.

Maybe I’ll circle back to these themes again and again — but that’s not failure. That’s healing.  
It’s a spiral. It deepens every time. And just because something feels complete now doesn’t mean I won’t see it differently later.

So I keep going.  
I keep showing up.  
Because who am I to decide what’s most impactful for someone else?  
Maybe the blog I nearly didn’t write is the one that lands the hardest.  
Maybe the words I second-guess are the ones that echo for someone when they need it most.

Or maybe they’re just for me.  
And maybe that’s exactly the point.

**Empathy without responsibility.  
Expression without permission.  
Healing without needing to be heard.**

I trust the process.  
And I keep going.
