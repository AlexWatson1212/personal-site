My body battery’s low.  
Same as yesterday. Maybe even lower.  
But something’s different today.

I feel energised.  
Not in a frantic way. Not wired.  
Just… steady. Aligned. Clear.

My watch says I should be crashing.  
But I’m not.  
Because I didn’t abandon myself today.

I trusted my gut in a strange conversation.  
I kept my boundaries without needing to make a scene.  
I stayed true to what felt right for me — not what would smooth things over, or keep things light, or keep other people comfortable.

And that, apparently, charges something deeper than my nervous system.  
My soul battery is full.

Maybe it helps that I know I can check out a bit tomorrow — rest, recover, not push.  
But I think the real reason I feel okay is because I lived in integrity today.

And the more I live like that —  
honest, grounded, unshakeable —  
the less I seem to drain.

Maybe that’s what real energy is.
