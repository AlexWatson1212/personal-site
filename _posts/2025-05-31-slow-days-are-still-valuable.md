Some days, I move slower.

Not because I’m lazy.  
Not because I’m behind.  
But because my body—and my soul—need a different rhythm.

And I used to fight that.  
I’d push through fatigue.  
Fill every minute.  
Measure my worth by what I got done.

But now I’m learning:

**Slow days are still valuable.**

Rest is not the opposite of progress.  
It’s what makes sustainable growth possible.

A day spent reflecting, reading, breathing—  
That matters.

A day where I choose to *be* instead of always doing—  
That’s not wasted.

It’s a reset. A recalibration. A reminder that I’m a human being, not a machine.

So I honour my energy now.

I trust the quieter pace when it calls me.

Because some of my best insights, healing, and creativity?  
They’ve come from the stillness I once tried to avoid.
