When I’m triggered, advice doesn’t land.

It doesn’t help to be told “just let it go” or “you’re safe now.” Even my own well-meaning reminders can feel hollow in the middle of a reaction.

What I need in those moments isn’t logic. It’s **presence**.

A soft voice. A grounded energy. A reminder that I’m not wrong or broken or failing—I’m just in a part of me that’s overwhelmed. That part needs *comfort*, not correction.

Here’s what I try to tell myself now:

> “Hey. I see you.  
> This is old.  
> You’re safe now, but it makes sense that it doesn’t feel that way.  
> You’re not too much.  
> You’re just feeling a lot.  
> Let’s breathe through it together.”

That voice? That’s the one I’m practicing.

Because healing isn’t about never being triggered.  
It’s about who meets me in that moment—especially when that person is me.
