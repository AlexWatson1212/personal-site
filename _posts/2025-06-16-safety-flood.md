I don’t think I realised how emotionally intense college would be — not because of the course content, but because of what safety does to a system that’s lived in survival for too long.

During my Level 2 and 3 counselling training, I spent most of my time overwhelmed and overstimulated. Anxious before every session. Taking breaks just to breathe. Struggling to show up. Not because I didn’t care — but because I cared so much, and my nervous system didn’t know how to process it.

For the first time in a long time, I was in an environment where people genuinely cared. And instead of that bringing me ease, it *brought everything I’d been missing into focus*.  
It triggered a deep, buried grief.

> *This is what connection could feel like? This is what I’ve been without?*

On my very first day, I had an open conversation with someone who felt emotionally present — and instead of feeling happy, I felt wrecked.  
It exposed the absence. The silence. The emptiness I’d lived with.  
And every week, showing up to that space reactivated that grief.

It’s taken me almost a year to regulate within it.  
To let my body know: *this is safe now.*  
To not crumble from the weight of being seen.

At some point, I noticed myself becoming drawn to someone in the group — someone I liked. And I’ve wondered, *was that just me trying to hold onto the emotional safety I felt around her?*

Maybe part of it was.  
But that doesn’t make it fake.

Because the truth is, I *did* like her.  
She’s a genuinely wonderful person — emotionally intelligent, kind, warm. I wasn’t projecting onto a blank screen.  
She’s someone worth liking.  
And I don’t regret that I did.

Even now, I’m learning not to overanalyse every feeling. Because if I did, I’d never move. Never connect. Never try.

This whole experience — the emotional overwhelm, the silent grief, the slow regulation — has taught me more than any textbook ever could:

> Sometimes safety doesn’t bring peace right away.  
> Sometimes it opens the floodgates.  
> Not because something’s wrong — but because we’re finally safe enough to *feel* what’s been buried all along.

And I’m proud of the me who kept turning up.  
Who kept breathing.  
Who kept softening, even when it hurt.

Because that’s not collapse.  
That’s healing.
