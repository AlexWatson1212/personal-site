In this video, I share my reflections on the truth that **healing is not a finish line**. For a long time, I believed that if I just worked hard enough, processed deeply enough, or broke through enough barriers, I’d arrive somewhere permanent—safe, whole, untouched by struggle.  

But what I’ve come to realise is that **healing never really ends**. And that’s not a failure—it’s simply part of being human. Life will keep presenting us with new challenges, new losses, new mirrors that show us where we’re still tender. Each stage of life asks us to grow in different ways.  

That doesn’t mean the work we’ve done isn’t valuable. It means the opposite: the tools we’ve built, the compassion we’ve cultivated, the strength we’ve earned—they carry us through the next chapter. Every cycle deepens us.  

Healing is more like a spiral than a straight line. We revisit old themes, but from a different vantage point, with more awareness than before. And slowly, we begin to trust the process itself rather than chasing an end point.  

When we accept that there is no “done,” something softens. The pressure eases. We can meet ourselves where we are, with less judgment and more patience. That, in itself, is healing.

### Prompts for Reflection
- Do you ever find yourself chasing the idea of being “fully healed”?  
- How might your perspective shift if you saw healing as a lifelong companion rather than a destination?  
- What tools or practices have you already built that help you through new challenges?  
- Can you notice a time when revisiting an old wound allowed you to see it with greater wisdom?
