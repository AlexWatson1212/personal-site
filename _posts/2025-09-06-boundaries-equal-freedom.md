In this video, I talk about how **boundaries are not walls but filters**—they don’t shut life out, they let the right things in while keeping the harmful things from overwhelming us.  

For a long time, I thought boundaries meant shutting people out. What I’ve come to learn is that boundaries actually give me *more openness*, not less. They’re the framework that allows me to show up fully, without resentment, without fear of being taken advantage of, and without carrying relationships that drain me.

When we don’t set boundaries, we end up abandoning ourselves to maintain connection. That might look like:
- Saying yes when our body is screaming no.  
- Keeping people around who continuously take without giving.  
- Accepting disrespect because it feels safer than walking away.  

It’s not really connection when it comes at the cost of ourselves. It’s survival. And survival is exhausting.  

The real turning point for me has been recognizing that **boundaries create freedom**:
- Freedom to choose who I let close.  
- Freedom to trust that I’ll protect myself if someone crosses the line.  
- Freedom to welcome new, healthier relationships because I know I won’t lose myself in them.  

It’s also about self-trust. Every time I set a boundary, I remind myself: *I can handle whatever comes*. Whether the other person respects it or not isn’t the point. The point is that I stood with myself.  

This is part of a bigger pattern I’ve been living out these past months—learning to stop pouring energy into places that never gave it back, choosing peace over people-pleasing, and slowly realising that it’s okay if some relationships end when truth arrives.  

When I let go of what drains me, I finally have room for what nourishes me. That’s the quiet revolution: one act of self-respect at a time.

### Prompts for Reflection
- Where in your life are you giving away energy without return?  
- What boundary would bring you the most relief if you actually set it?  
- How might your relationships shift if you believed that the right people *want* you to have boundaries?  
- Can you think of one small “no” you could practice this week that honours your energy?
