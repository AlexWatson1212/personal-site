What does it mean to reclaim your own authority?

In Chapter 19 of *Living an Examined Life*, James Hollis reminds us that we are always answering to something — a belief system, a culture, a family script, a voice from the past.

But unless we pause and ask *who* we’re actually answering to, we might live our entire life trying to please ghosts — while our soul starves.

> “Who is the authority in your life?”  
> — James Hollis

That question stopped me.

Because for so long, my authority was survival.  
- I answered to the fear of being too much.  
- I answered to the guilt of disappointing people.  
- I answered to rules I never agreed to, just to keep the peace.

Even after I cut ties, distanced myself, and built a more honest life — I can still feel the old pull.  
The instinct to check: *Is this allowed?*  
*Is this safe?*  
*Will someone be angry if I choose this for myself?*

But real adulthood — real freedom — means turning inward and asking:  
**What do *I* know to be true?**  
**What do *I* value, even if no one else agrees?**  
**What life do *I* want to live, regardless of how it’s received?**

This isn’t about defiance.  
It’s about *integrity*.

And integrity, Hollis says, means living in alignment with our own soul — even when it costs us approval.

I’m not here to follow a script that was written before I even had language.  
I’m here to write something new — even if my voice shakes while I do it.

That’s what reclaiming authority looks like.  
Not certainty. Not bravado.  
Just a quiet, steady return to the person I was always meant to be.
