*In this video, I talk about the “season of letting go”: how a simple sunrise-and-full-moon morning became a glimmer, and why growth so often happens in the pause after an automatic reaction.*

## What I mean by “the season of letting go”

Letting go, for me, isn’t a grand purge. It’s quieter. It’s releasing the tiny clenches I didn’t notice I was holding: a story about myself, a hidden should, an old defence that once kept me safe. It’s trusting there’s something solid underneath when I loosen my grip.

## Glimmers: the nervous system’s “yes”

A **glimmer** is a brief moment of safety, beauty, or ease that helps my nervous system exhale — sunlight on a wall, the sound of a kettle, a dog’s yawn, a kind look from a stranger. The sunrise with the full moon this morning was one of those moments. I’m learning to let these be **information**: *I’m safe enough to soften here.*

## The power of the pause (after the reaction)

The first reaction is often the old pattern — the inner child moving fast to protect me. The pause is where growth lives.

**My micro-practice:**
1. **Notice** the spark (tension, spike, urge to defend/run/fix).
2. **Pause** for one slow breath. Feel feet, jaw, shoulders. (No story, just body.)
3. **Choose** a 2% kinder action — curiosity instead of certainty, silence instead of a speech, “I need a minute” instead of pushing through.

It’s small, but small stacks up.

## What I’m letting go of (today)

- The belief that urgency equals importance.  
- The habit of performing calm instead of *feeling* it.  
- The idea that everything meaningful has to be hard.

## A tiny experiment for the week

- **Collect glimmers:** one line a day. (Morning light. Warm mug. Dog’s tail. A lyric.)  
- **Add one pause:** pick a common trigger and practice a single breath there.  
- **Reflect in one sentence:** “When I paused, I noticed…”

## Journal prompts

- Where in my body do I notice myself *holding on* most lately?  
- What am I afraid will happen if I loosen my grip there?  
- Which glimmer did I almost miss today — and what shifted when I noticed it?  
- What’s one belief or “should” I’m willing to set down *for now*?  
- How might a 2% kinder action look in the moment I usually spiral?

If the video resonated, this is your gentle nudge to find one glimmer today and give yourself one honest pause. That’s enough.
