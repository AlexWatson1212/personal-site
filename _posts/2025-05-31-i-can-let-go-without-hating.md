I used to think I needed to be angry to walk away.

That in order to let go of someone or something,  
I had to build a case.  
Prove they were wrong.  
Feel betrayed or mistreated enough to justify the distance.

But now I see that letting go doesn’t have to be dramatic.

**I can let go without hating.**

I can release someone with peace in my heart.  
I can honour what we had *and* acknowledge it no longer fits.  
I can hold compassion without inviting them back into my life.

Some people were meant to walk with me for a season—not a lifetime.  
Some experiences were here to shape me—not to stay forever.

That’s not failure.

It’s growth.

And as I keep growing, I give myself permission to move forward—

With love.  
With grace.  
With the quiet confidence that I don’t need to carry what no longer feels true.

I can wish them well—and keep walking.
