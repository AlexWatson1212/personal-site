Today’s counselling session showed me some important dynamics in myself.  

I realised that I often use humour as a way of bridging into connection or easing tension. My intentions are good — I want to reassure or lighten the atmosphere — but I’m beginning to see how humour can sometimes create distance instead of closeness. What I mean and how it’s received aren’t always the same.  

This connects to another double standard I noticed: I sometimes get irritated when people ask me interview-style questions, yet I ask similar things when I want to connect. That awareness shows me that blind spots are best revealed not by theory, but by paying attention in real relationship.  

Much of the session itself felt tedious at times, but I genuinely valued the moments of connection. That’s a reminder that growth isn’t always exciting; sometimes it’s subtle shifts in how I show up.  

I don’t need to prove myself by being funny or entertaining. I’m enough as I am. If I can soften my approach, filter without overthinking, and trust the natural flow of connection, then humour becomes optional — not armour.
