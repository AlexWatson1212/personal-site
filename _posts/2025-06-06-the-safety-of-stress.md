description: Sometimes the tasks that stress us the most feel oddly familiar — because our nervous system learned to equate uncertainty with danger. But healing means staying with it, and choosing a different response.

I was just trying to fix a curtain rail.

That was the task. Straightforward in theory. But there I was, stress levels through the roof, body buzzing like I was under threat, fumbling with screws and wondering why something so minor felt so overwhelming.

And then it hit me: **maybe I don’t get stressed by these tasks just because they’re unfamiliar. Maybe I’m drawn to them because they feel familiar.** Not the tasks themselves — but the dysregulation they bring up. The not-knowing. The self-doubt. The shame of getting it wrong.

It’s not that I love the feeling of stress. It’s that part of me is still trying to **work something through** — something old, something deep.

### Childhood didn’t give me room to not know

Growing up, I don’t remember being gently guided through the uncertainty of learning. I don’t remember being told, “It’s okay not to know — let’s figure it out together.”  
Instead, I remember the heat of being watched, the sting of being mocked, the unspoken message:  
> “You’re only safe when you’re certain.”

So I learned to perform. To hide my vulnerability. To act like I knew what I was doing — even when I didn’t. Especially when I didn’t.

And now, even though I’m no longer in that environment, my body still flares up in those familiar moments:  
- When the drill slips.  
- When the screw won’t bite.  
- When I pause, unsure what to do next.

That’s when it whispers, *Careful. You’re being seen.*

### But here’s what’s different now

This time, no one is mocking me.  
No one is trying to keep me small.  
No one is watching for a weakness to exploit.

It’s just me, a curtain rail, and the ghosts of a nervous system that hasn’t yet caught up to the truth.

But I’m staying with it. I’m breathing through it.  
I’m choosing to believe that **this moment of not knowing is not a threat.**  
It’s an invitation — to meet myself differently.

### Words I say to myself now:

- “This feels familiar, but it’s not dangerous.”  
- “No one’s watching me fail. I’m allowed to learn.”  
- “I am not small — I’m growing.”

And maybe, just maybe, **every screw I drive is an act of rebellion against the shame that once silenced me.**

Even if it’s just a curtain rail.
