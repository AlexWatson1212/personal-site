I shoved KQo with 14 big blinds four-handed, and he woke up with Ace-King.  
And that’s the game. Fourth place.

I don’t regret it.

It was the right move, the right hand, the right time.  
I wasn’t scared. I wasn’t chasing. I played to win.

Earlier, I folded second pair to a big turn barrel because I knew I was beat.  
I didn’t let ego call me into a mistake.  
I stayed sharp. I played the spots. I held myself through it all.

And now, I’ve cashed for $800+. I’ve grown my bankroll.  
I’ve hit a new high — not just in chips, but in confidence.

Because today, I didn’t just make a final table.

> *I played like someone who belongs there.*

And I’ll be back.
