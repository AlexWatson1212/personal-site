Healing doesn’t always look like strength.  
Sometimes it looks like *barely getting through the day*.  
Or walking away from something that hurts, even when you want it to work.  
Or crying for reasons you can’t name — and letting the tears come anyway.

So when it feels like you’re not making progress, come back to these quiet signs:

### 🌿 Small Markers of Healing

- You pause instead of reacting.
- You notice when you're overwhelmed — and you name it.
- You speak to yourself with slightly more kindness than you used to.
- You no longer try to fix or chase people who don't meet you.
- You walk away from things that once hooked you.
- You feel grief **and let it happen**.
- You don't abandon yourself in the name of being liked.
- You hold space for others without losing your own ground.
- You catch yourself before spiraling — even if just once.
- You choose rest instead of guilt-tripping yourself into productivity.
- You allow joy without assuming it will disappear.
- You cry. Not because you're broken — but because you're healing.
- You feel the urge to numb... and sometimes, you don’t.
- You no longer need to *prove* your worth in every room.
- You stop and say, “I don’t know what I need, but I know I need something.”

### 🕯 You're Becoming Softer — Not Weaker

Healing isn’t just becoming tougher.  
It’s becoming **more honest**.  
More gentle.  
More *in tune* with your needs.

If you’ve felt tired lately, disconnected, or unsure — maybe you’re not doing anything wrong.  
Maybe you're just in a part of the story where the roots grow deeper than the leaves.

And that’s still growth.

### 💬 Keep Going

The version of you that doubted everything, chased unavailable love, and never rested — you’re already leaving them behind.

Not perfectly.  
Not linearly.  
But steadily.

One small marker at a time.
