I think my dad would be proud of my website.

Not just the look of it — though he’d probably enjoy the design, the fact that I built it myself, the way it functions — but what it represents. The truth in it. The quiet rebellion of it. The decision to tell my story openly, honestly, without shame. I think he’d see it as a continuation of something he never quite got to do himself.

He had stories in him. Wisdom. Pain. Love. And I think he spent a lot of his life swallowing those stories so they wouldn’t cause trouble. So they wouldn’t hurt people. Maybe he thought the truth was too heavy to carry out loud. I get that. I lived that, too.

But now I don’t want to carry it quietly anymore. I want to live it. To share it. Not to shame anyone. Not to throw stones. But to stop abandoning myself.

If my words hurt someone, maybe they need to ask why. Maybe they should ask themselves what choices they made to be cast in those stories the way they are. Because the truth doesn’t hurt unless it exposes something you’ve been trying to hide.

And I’ve hidden long enough.

If anything, I think my dad would laugh. He’d find it funny that I’ve built a space where the mask comes off — not just mine, but the ones others hoped I’d keep wearing. He might even say, “Well, someone had to tell it.”

He'd see that this isn’t about revenge. It's about release. And it's not for everyone — but it's for someone. Even if that someone is just me, and maybe my son one day.

I’m not here to convince the world of who I am anymore. I’m just here to be it.

And I think he’d respect that more than anything.
