There’s a sting that comes when someone doesn’t choose me.

When I show up open, honest, willing—and it’s not met. When I feel something real, and they… don’t. Or maybe they do, but not enough to stay. Not enough to try.

And for a long time, I made that mean something about *me*.

> “You’re not enough.”  
> “You were too much.”  
> “You scared them off.”  
> “You did it wrong.”

But the truth is—**their decision isn’t a measure of my worth.**

People walk away for all kinds of reasons that have nothing to do with who I am. And sometimes, rejection is just redirection wrapped in pain.

I can grieve it.  
I can feel it.  
But I don’t have to carry it as a reflection of my value.

I am still loveable.  
I am still growing.  
I am still becoming.

And the right people?  
They won’t need convincing.

They’ll choose me freely—because they *want* to.

Until then, I’ll keep choosing myself
