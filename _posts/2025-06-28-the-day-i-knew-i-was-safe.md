I didn’t expect today to feel like a turning point — but it is.

Something shifted in me. Not dramatically. Not with fanfare. Just quietly… finally.

I cried a little earlier, not out of sadness, but from a deep sense of *recognition*. A part of me — probably the boy inside — finally realised just how strong I’ve become. And not in a performative, showy way. But in a real, grounded, sovereign way.

I’ve had the body. I’ve had the training. I’ve had the capacity to protect myself for years — maybe two decades. But I’ve always felt like I needed to be *careful* with it. Like I didn’t trust it. Like it might explode out or cause damage. Like I had to hold it tightly in check so I wouldn’t become what I feared.

But I don’t feel that anymore.

Now I feel it integrated.

I’m not walking around trying to intimidate anyone. I’m not looking for confrontation. But if someone puts their hands on me, I will *handle it*. I’ll take them down calmly. I’ll call the police without hesitation. I’ll protect myself with precision, and I won’t feel guilty for a second.

Because I have too much to lose. I have a son to care for. A life I’m building. A body and mind I’ve worked hard to reclaim. I won’t let anyone take that from me.

And it’s strange — this feeling I’m sitting in, it’s not rage. It’s not tension. It’s peace. It’s like I’ve finally welcomed home the part of me I was scared of. The part that used to sit in the shadows, ready to fight or run. He’s not bracing anymore. He’s sitting beside me.

I feel *safe* now — not because the world is safe, but because I trust myself in it.

The grief I’ve carried — all those years of fear, powerlessness, and pretending I was fine — it’s started to compost. That’s the word that comes to mind. It’s turned into something solid. Something nourishing. Something *useful*.

It doesn’t feel like grief when you’re in it. It feels like dying. But now I see — after the grief comes the integration. The knowing. The groundedness.

I’m not scared of being tested. I don’t want to be. But if it happens, I’m ready. Calmly. Completely. And without shame.

So yeah… today was the day I knew I was finally safe.

And no one can take that from me now.
