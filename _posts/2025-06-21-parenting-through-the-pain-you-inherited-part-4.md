It surprised me, honestly — how quickly joy returned when I made space for it.

Not big joy. Not fireworks or perfect days.  
But small joy. The kind you almost miss unless you're paying attention.

Like watching him make up his own rules to a game and laughing so hard he can’t explain them.  
Like the warmth of the dog curled up near us while we both just… rest.  
Like noticing I’m not gritting my teeth through the evening routine — I’m actually there.

These moments don’t come from effort.  
They come from the absence of burnout.

When I stopped forcing myself to be some perfect version of a dad — when I allowed rest, space, boundaries — joy found its own way in.

It wasn’t that the love had ever gone.  
It was just buried under everything I hadn’t processed.

And now, without so much weight, I can actually feel it.

**Reflective Question for You:**  
*What kind of joy do you miss when you’re just trying to survive?*
