Description: Chapter 20 of *Living an Examined Life* invites us to stop chasing premature answers — and instead live into the questions life is asking of us, moment by moment.
Emotions: [hope, fear]

Some things can’t be solved.  
They can only be *lived through*.

In Chapter 20 of *Living an Examined Life*, James Hollis challenges the ego’s constant craving for certainty.  
He suggests that maybe our task isn’t to figure everything out — but to **sit with the mystery** long enough for deeper meaning to emerge.

> “The goal is not to answer the question but to become the person for whom the question is no longer a question.”  
> — James Hollis

This hit me hard.

Because I want answers.  
I want to know which course to take.  
Whether I’ll feel secure.  
When this aching loneliness will lift.  
What my future holds.

But Hollis gently says: *You don’t need to know that yet.*

Maybe the more important question is:
**Can I stay present in the not-knowing — and trust that I’m becoming someone new in the process?**

Because rushing toward answers usually means grasping for safety.  
And safety isn’t always truth.  
Sometimes it’s just the old cage, repainted.

But if I can slow down…  
if I can hold the tension between where I’ve been and where I’m going…  
then maybe I’m already living the answer — just not in language yet.

So tonight, I’m not asking life to explain itself.  
I’m asking myself to keep showing up — awake, honest, and open to the mystery.

I don’t need to solve it.  
I just need to live it.
