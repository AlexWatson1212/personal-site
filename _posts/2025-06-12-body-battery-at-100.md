For the first time in what feels like over a month, my body battery hit 100%.

Not just a number on a screen — but a felt sense that something deep within me is starting to rest. A quiet signal from my nervous system that it finally feels safe enough to recharge. For weeks, I’ve been pouring myself into emotional work, processing old pain, parenting full-time, holding boundaries, rebuilding my sense of self. And while I’ve made progress, I’ve also been drained.

Reaching 100% feels surreal. I’m not used to this kind of surplus. There’s a temptation to sprint, to “make the most” of it. But I know better now. This kind of energy isn’t something to cash in on. It’s something to honour.

I still want to be careful with it. Gently curious. Like I’m meeting a part of myself that’s been gone for a while — not pushing, just saying: *“Welcome back. You can rest now. You don’t need to fight so hard anymore.”*

If this is what my new normal looks like — if this is what’s becoming possible — then I feel genuinely excited about life. I can begin doing things as I please, not out of pressure or urgency, but from a place of choice. There’s a freedom here. A lightness. A new rhythm that I didn’t have access to before.

And the most important part?  
I didn’t force this.

I created the conditions for it — by listening, slowing down, protecting my peace, and offering myself the love I needed.

This isn’t just a recovery. It’s a quiet becoming.
