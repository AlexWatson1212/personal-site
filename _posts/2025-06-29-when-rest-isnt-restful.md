description: Sometimes we rest and still feel exhausted. It doesn’t mean we’re lazy — it means we’re healing from a deeper kind of depletion.

Lately, I’ve had time to myself — complete autonomy, quiet space, no parenting responsibilities — and yet… I still feel exhausted.

I’ve tried resting. Napping. Managing energy with care.  
I’ve even succeeded in external ways — I’ve won around $5,000 in the last couple of days at poker, and I’ve been reflecting deeply, setting intentions for the future.

And yet… the battery won’t recharge.

I’m running on 16% most days, even when I do everything “right.”

## 🧠 This Isn’t Laziness. It’s Healing.

What I’ve come to realise is this:  
> I’m not tired from *doing too much right now*.  
> I’m tired because my body is *finally safe enough* to start letting go of years of survival mode.

The freeze state — that quiet, numb, low-energy shutdown — is something I used to live in without even realising it.  
And now that I’m safe, authentic, and no longer performing… I can *feel* how depleted I really am underneath it all.

## 🔄 This Isn’t Just Rest — It’s Rewiring

The frustration makes sense. I want to use this free time. I want to be productive.  
But my body is doing something far deeper than ticking boxes.

It’s **repatterning**.

It’s learning what it means to move without urgency.  
To exist without having to earn rest.  
To trust that slowness isn’t failure — it’s **integration**.

And that’s exhausting in a very different way.

## ⚡ When External Success Doesn’t Match Internal Energy

The paradox is strange.  
I’m winning at poker. I’m making good decisions. I’m more strategic and deliberate.

And I still feel drained.

But maybe that’s the point:  
> I’m being forced into a new way of doing things — one that doesn’t rely on adrenaline, anxiety, or pressure.

Instead of running on fumes, I’m learning how to live from alignment.  
And that’s taking everything I have right now.

## 🌿 A Reminder to Myself

This week is not wasted.  
Even if I don’t “do” much.  
Even if I’m slow, flat, tired, or uninspired.

This is part of the process.  
I’m not failing — I’m finally stopping the cycle of internal abandonment.

> I have no choice but to be authentic and kind with myself now.  
> Because all other roads lead back to misery.

And even if I only have 16% battery, I’ll use it wisely.  
Not to perform — but to stay with myself through the healing.
