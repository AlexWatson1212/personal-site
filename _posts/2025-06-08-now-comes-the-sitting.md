After all the words.  
After the unraveling.  
After the truth has been named and the illusions stripped bare —  
there’s not much left to do.

Except sit.  
And stay.

### 🪨 Sitting With the Ache

This isn’t the kind of grief that needs fixing.  
It’s the kind that needs *presence*.

Not understanding.  
Not explanation.  
Just stillness.

Because what I’m feeling now isn’t confusion anymore.  
It’s reality.  
Cold, quiet, and heavy.

The truth that I wasn’t loved in the way I needed.  
That maybe they both thought they loved me.  
But neither of them knew how to hold me.

### 💔 The Ache of the Unheld

It’s not just sadness.  
It’s the ache of:

- being unseen  
- being misunderstood  
- being pushed away and blamed for it  
- being told love was there when all I felt was distance

It’s the ache of *almost* being loved.  
Of sensing the possibility, but never being chosen fully.

And now that I see it — *really see it* — I can’t unsee it.

### 🧘🏽‍♂️ So Now I Sit

Not to collapse.  
Not to give up.  
But to say, maybe for the first time:

> “I’m not abandoning myself too.”

I’m not reaching for the next answer.  
I’m not trying to escape the heaviness.  
I’m not proving I’m healed.

I’m just *here*.

---

### 🕯 Staying Is the Work Now

Because maybe this is where the real healing begins:

- Not when the pain goes away  
- But when I learn I can *stay* with it  
- When I stop leaving myself every time it hurts  
- When I stop calling it progress only when I feel better

This is progress too.  
This sitting.  
This staying.  
This stillness.

### 💬 A Quiet Promise

To the part of me that still aches, still questions, still longs:

> I’m not going anywhere.  
> Even if nothing changes.  
> Even if this takes time.  
> Even if the wound never fully closes.

You are safe with me.  
Not because it doesn’t hurt anymore —  
But because I’m finally willing to sit with you while it does.
