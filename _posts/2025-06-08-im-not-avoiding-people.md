There was a time I thought I was avoiding people.  
That maybe I was still running from closeness.  
That maybe I was still afraid.

But now I see it differently.

Iâ€™m not avoiding people.  
Iâ€™m just learning to **trust myself**.

### ðŸ§  What Looked Like Withdrawal Was Actually Clarity

For most of my life, I second-guessed myself.  
I questioned every feeling, every reaction, every boundary.  
I stayed in relationships that made me feel invisible â€” and felt guilty when I finally stepped away.

But Iâ€™ve come to realise that pulling back isnâ€™t always fear.  
Sometimes, itâ€™s self-respect.

Sometimes, itâ€™s recognising that staying connected to people who canâ€™t meet you only continues the internal story that youâ€™re unworthy of being met at all.

### ðŸŒ¿ Letting Go Isnâ€™t Avoidance â€” Itâ€™s Choosing Peace

Iâ€™ve let some relationships go.  
Not because Iâ€™m scared of connection, but because **the connection wasnâ€™t real**.

It was one-sided.  
Performative.  
Draining.

And for once, I didnâ€™t stay to prove I could endure it.  
I walked away because I deserve better â€” and because the boy in me deserves better too.

### ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m Not Isolating â€” Iâ€™m Integrating

Iâ€™m alone a lot. But I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m isolating.  
I think Iâ€™m **recharging**.  
**Processing grief**.  
**Letting go of illusions** I used to cling to for safety.

And when I do connect â€” whether itâ€™s with someone I trust at college, or with a stranger I meet gently â€” I show up more honestly than ever before.

Thatâ€™s not fear.  
Thatâ€™s growth.

### ðŸªž The Old Wounds Still Echo â€” But Iâ€™m Aware Now

Yes, I still project sometimes.  
Yes, I still get triggered by women in authority.  
Yes, I still have an inner child who looks for safety in old patterns.

But Iâ€™m not running from that anymore.  
Iâ€™m not shaming it.  
Iâ€™m choosing people who can hold space for it â€” and Iâ€™m learning to hold it myself.

### ðŸ©¹ Iâ€™m Not Second-Guessing Because Iâ€™m Weak

My second-guessing was **cultivated** â€” especially by my mother.  
She called it a weakness.  
But I see now it was a seed of self-doubt she planted to keep me small.

Iâ€™m slowly unlearning that.  
Iâ€™m learning that I can trust my body. My gut. My truth.

Even if Iâ€™m not always certain â€” Iâ€™m no longer abandoning myself to gain approval.

### ðŸ•¯ I Want to Let Love In

Iâ€™m not chasing it.  
Iâ€™m not afraid of it.  
I just want to be **ready for it** â€” when itâ€™s real.

And that means accepting myself as I am now:  
Still healing. Still learning. Still worthy.

Not perfect.  
Not finished.  
But open.

Because Iâ€™m not avoiding people anymore.  
Iâ€™m just building a world where I can finally show up *as myself* â€” and not apologise for it.
