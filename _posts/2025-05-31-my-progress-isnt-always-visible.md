There are days when it feels like nothing’s changing.

Same thoughts.  
Same habits.  
Same quiet struggles playing on repeat.

But if I look closer—really pay attention—I can see it:

**I’m not the same man I was six months ago.**

I pause more.  
I reflect more.  
I respond, where I used to react.  
I set boundaries I used to avoid.  
I speak up when it matters—even if my voice shakes.

That’s growth. Even if no one claps for it.

Not every breakthrough comes with fireworks.  
Some come in the form of a gentler tone with myself.  
An urge resisted.  
A moment of peace where panic used to live.

So no—I may not always *see* my progress in the mirror.

But I feel it in the way I carry myself now.

And that’s enough.

Quiet change is still change.

And I’m proud of that.
