Title: It Wasn’t Just a Trigger — It Was a Violation
Date: 2025-06-23
Tags: boundaries, emotional-regulation, trauma-response
Description: Sometimes we say we were triggered — but the truth is, we were disrespected in real time. And what looks like composure from the outside might be years of healing in action.
Emotions: [anger, shame]

That moment in class — when my tutor brought up something I’d shared six months earlier, in front of a room full of people —  
that might have been the most triggered I’ve been in years.

It wasn’t just unexpected.  
It wasn’t just inappropriate.  
It was *violating*.

I didn’t ask for feedback.  
I wasn’t struggling with the assignment.  
And I had made it explicitly clear the week before that I didn’t want to discuss personal matters in front of the group.

But she brought it up anyway.  
No warning.  
No check-in.  
Just public exposure — dressed up as help.

In that moment, something deep stirred in me.  
It wasn’t just a childhood wound.  
And it wasn’t just adult anger.  
It was **both** — fused together.

The part of me that remembered what it was like to be shamed publicly, not protected, exposed without defence.  
And the part of me that *knew* what she was doing was out of line — *right now*, in the present.

I stayed composed.  
I set a soft boundary:  
> “I’d rather not talk about this here.”

She pushed again.

And then, when I still didn’t react the way she expected, she said:

> *“That’s growth, because before you would have reacted.”*

No.

That wasn’t growth.  
That was me holding a line *you should never have crossed*.

You don’t get to provoke someone, ignore their clearly expressed boundaries, drag their vulnerability into the light without consent —  
and then claim credit for their self-control.

That’s not a compliment.  
That’s gaslighting.

That’s manipulation.  
That’s rewriting the power dynamic to make yourself the wise guide — while quietly stripping away someone’s dignity.

What hurt more was that I trusted her.  
We had rapport.  
She wasn’t a stranger.  
And that made it worse — because it meant I believed she’d respect me.

But instead, she put me in a situation where any response would make me look unstable.

And yet again —  
I didn’t react.  
I didn’t explode.  
I didn’t collapse.

I regulated.

And I should be proud of that — not just because of my past, but because of how **clean** my anger was.

I didn’t suppress it.  
I didn’t let it hijack me.  
I held it.

Carl Jung might say:  
> *“Your anger was the Self rising up to defend the sacred space within you.”*

Carl Rogers might say:  
> *“You were congruent in the face of incongruence. That’s maturity.”*

And I agree with both of them.

---

I’ve since realised:  
I still wanted to believe she was on my side.  
That’s the hardest part.  
To admit that someone you trusted *wasn’t looking out for you*.  
That they saw your past not as strength, but as something to be tested — *poked*, *prodded*, *provoked* — just to see if you’d snap.

I didn’t snap.

I didn’t shut down.

I stood my ground.

And no one gets to rewrite that.

**Reflective question:**  
Have you ever called something a “trigger” — when actually, it was someone crossing a line they never should have touched?
