I’ve been thinking about this for a long time.  
Not in panic. Not emotionally charged.  
Just… quietly. Intuitively. In the background of everything else I’ve been carrying.

And now, it feels clear:  
Getting a vasectomy wouldn’t be about giving something up.  
It would be about taking something back.

Because I don’t want more biological children.  
Not because I wouldn’t love them — but because I’ve already been through a chapter that almost broke me.  
And I’m still here.  
I’m still showing up for my son.  
But I know how much it costs me to do that well — and I know I couldn’t survive doing it again alone.

If my ex had lived further away…  
If I’d had him full-time, with no reprieve…  
I don’t think either of us would be okay right now.  
That’s not drama. That’s just honesty.

This choice is coming from love — and from limits.  
I love my son more than anything. And I know what it takes to be that kind of dad.  
There’s no need to recreate that journey. I’ve walked it. I’ve bled in it. And I’m proud of who I’ve become through it.

And if one day I do feel called to raise another child — I’ll adopt.  
Or I’ll love someone else’s child as my own.  
I think I’d be good at that — not from obligation, but from overflow. From calm. From capacity.

This is about finally taking the pressure off.  
Letting sex feel safe again.  
Letting myself get close to someone without a silent voice saying, “What if?”  
It’s not the fear of pregnancy — it’s the fear of breaking under the weight of something I never chose again.

This is about reclaiming peace.  
Not from bitterness — but from truth.

This is peace. This is clarity. This is mine.
