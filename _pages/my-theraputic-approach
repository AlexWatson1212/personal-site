My Therapeutic Approach

My work is grounded in creating a warm, real, and supportive relationship where you can explore your thoughts and feelings safely.

Here’s what working with me feels like:

A human connection: I’m genuine, grounded, and easy to talk to. The relationship is at the heart of the work.

A pace that suits you: No pressure, no expectations — we go slowly and steadily, based on what feels right.

A focus on authenticity: Many people lose touch with who they are. Together we explore what’s true for you, beyond roles and expectations.

Understanding emotions: Feelings aren’t problems — they’re signals. I help you make sense of them so they feel less overwhelming.

Support for relationships: Whether with partners, family, or yourself, we work on communication, boundaries, and connection.

Gentle challenge: When helpful, I’ll offer insights that support your growth while always respecting your pace and boundaries.

A belief in your potential: You don’t need to be “sorted.” You just need to show up. Change grows from there.


My approach is calm, relational, and human.
I aim to help you build a life that feels more connected, grounded, and authentically your own.
