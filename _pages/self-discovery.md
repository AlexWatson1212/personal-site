      <p><strong>Who this is for:</strong><br>
      This page is for anyone who feels like they’ve been surviving, not living — whether you're 12 or 112.  
      If you want a clearer path home to yourself, this guide will meet you where you are.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you've found your way here, part of you already knows there's more to life than what you've been told. This is a soft place to land and a steady hand for your journey home to yourself.</p>

    <div style="background: #ffeaea; padding: 1rem; border-left: 4px solid #a00; margin-top: 1.5rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
      <p><strong>Please read this before you begin:</strong><br>
      Self-discovery can stir up memories, emotions, or trauma that have been buried for years. If you don’t have much support right now, we encourage you to be gentle with yourself. Take your time. There’s no rush. And if possible, consider walking this path with a therapist, guide, or trusted support. You don’t have to do this alone — and we wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
    </div>

    <p><strong>This isn’t a course. It’s not something you “complete.”</strong><br>
    Think of these as doorways. You can step into whichever feels right, return later, or skip ahead. Healing isn’t linear. Use what helps. Leave what doesn’t.</p>
