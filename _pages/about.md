<h2>About Me</h2>

My name is Alex, and I’m a therapist in training who believes deeply in the power of honest, grounded human connection.

My path into this work hasn’t been a straight line.
Like many people, I’ve navigated my own challenges — questions about identity, emotional struggles, relationship difficulties, and periods of feeling disconnected from myself.
Those experiences didn’t break me; they shaped me.
They taught me compassion, patience, and the importance of having someone who truly listens.

I bring that understanding into every session.

I’m someone who values authenticity, warmth, and real conversation.
I’m not here to judge or diagnose who you should be.
I’m here to meet you where you are — with honesty, curiosity, and respect — and to support you as you begin to understand yourself more deeply.

I work in a way that is calm, steady, and emotionally present.
People often tell me they feel at ease around me, that they sense they can speak freely without having to perform or pretend.
That is the environment I aim to create:
a space where you can explore your inner world safely and at your own pace.

Outside of therapy, I’m a dad, a writer, a long-distance walker, and someone who finds joy in simple things — cooking, meaningful conversations, time outdoors, and building a life that feels aligned and purposeful.

I believe that healing doesn’t have to be dramatic to be meaningful.
Sometimes it’s the small shifts — the ones we hardly notice at first — that quietly change everything.

If you choose to work with me, my hope is that you’ll feel seen, understood, and supported as you navigate whatever brings you here.
